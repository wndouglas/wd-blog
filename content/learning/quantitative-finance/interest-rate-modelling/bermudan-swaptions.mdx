**Bermudan swaptions** are a common form of option on swaps. They are similar to standard vanilla swaptions, except the 
holder has the right to enter into a fixed-floating swap on any of a list of specified fixing dates up to expiry. For a 
given tenor structure
$$
    0 \le T_0 < T_1 < \cdots < T_N, \quad \tau_n = T_{n+1} - T_n,
$$
the holder of a Bermudan swaption has the right to exercise on any of the dates $\{T_n\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$. Once exercised 
on date $T_n$, the option terminates, and the holder enters the swap with the first fixing date $T_n$ and the final 
payment date $T_N$. The period leading up to $T_0$ is known as the **lockout** or **no-call** period. In common jargon, 
a Bermudan swaption on a 10 year swap with a 2 year lockout period is known as a *10 no-call 2* or *10nc2*
Bermudan swaption.

Demand for Bermudan swaptions is driven by various segments of the fixed income market. Mortgage companies use them to 
hedge their mortgage pools - the flexibility that the opportunity to exercise at various times gives them allows them 
to match the uncertain timings of mortgage prepayments. In contrast, investors seeking higher upfront income sell 
Bermudan swaptions - the additional optionality acts in favour of the holders of Bermudan-style options, leading to 
higher premiums versus an otherwise equivalent European swaption. Bermudan swaptions are also used in order to hedge 
callable Libor coupon bonds.

## Pricing Bermudan Swaptions

Formally, at time $T_n$, the value of a payer Bermudan swaption, if exercised, is the swap value
$$
    \begin{aligned}
    U_n(T_n)
    & = \beta(T_n) \sum_{i=n}^{N-1} \tau_i \mathbb{E}_{T_n}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[ \beta(T_{i+1})^{-1} (L_i(T_i) - K) \right] \\
    & = \sum_{i=n}^{N-1}\tau_i P(T_n, T_{i+1})(L_i(T_n) - K) \\
    & = A_{n, N-n}(T_n)(S_{n,N-n}(T_n) - K).
    \end{aligned}
$$
Loosely speaking, a Bermudan swaption is an option to choose between $U_n(T_n)$ for different $n=0,\ldots,N-1$.

By no-arbitrage, the value $V(T_n)$ of the Bermudan swaption at time $T_n$ is then given by the maximum of $U_n(T_n)$
and the **hold value** $H_n(T_n)$, the value of the Bermudan swaption with only the exercise dates 
$\{T_i\}_{i=n+1}^{N-1}$ remaining. It is assumed that a rational investor at time $T_n$ will observe the exercise value 
$U_n(T_n)$ along with the hold value $H_n(T_n)$ and decide to exercise only if they stand to gain at that instant by 
doing so. Hence, we find that
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        V(T_N) & = U_N(T_N) = 0, \\
        V(T_n) & = \text{max}(U_n(T_n), H_n(T_n)), \quad n=0,\ldots,N-1, \\
    \end{aligned}
$$
Meanwhile, the hold value $H_n(T_n)$ simply represents the value $V(T_{n}^+)$ of the option at the instant after the 
choice not to exercise was made. For $t \in (T_n, T_{n+1})$, the investor has no ability to exercise, so we find that
$H_n(t) = V(t)$ and hence, we have
$$
    H_n(T_n) = \beta(T_n) \mathbb{E}_{T_n}^{\mathbb{Q}} \left[\beta(T_{T_{n+1}})^{-1} V(T_{n+1}) \right]
$$
Combining the above yields
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        H_n(T_n) & = \beta(T_n) \mathbb{E}_{T_n}^{\mathbb{Q}} \left[\beta(T_{n+1})^{-1} \text{max}(U_{n+1}(T_{n+1}), H_{n+1}(T_{n+1})) \right], \quad n=0,\ldots, N-1, \\
        V(0) & = \beta(0) \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}} \left[\beta(T_{0})^{-1} V(T_0) \right] \\
        & = \beta(0) \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}} \left[\beta(T_{0})^{-1} \text{max}(U_0(T_0), H_0(T_0)) \right].
    \end{aligned}
$$
This defines a useful iteration backwards in time from the terminal time $T_N$, to the initial time $0$. The idea 
behind this iterative scheme is known as **dynamic programming**. Loosely speaking, we *work backwards* to price 
Bermudan options. Hence, pricing Bermudan swaptions is a problem naturally suited to numerical schemes that proceed 
backwards through time, in particular, *finite difference methods* and *tree-based methods* fit this description well.

On the flipside of the above point, methods such as *Monte Carlo pricing*, which are inherently *forward moving* in 
time, are poorly suited to pricing Bermudan options, and more sophisticated numerical techniques must be considered to 
produce accurate pricing.
