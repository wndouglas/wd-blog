**Macroeconomics** is the branch of economics dealing with performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an
economy as a whole. For example, using interest rates, taxes, and government spending to regulate an economy’s growth
and stability. This includes regional, national, and global economies.

Macroeconomists study topics such as: **GDP** (Gross Domestic Product), **unemployment** 
(including unemployment rates), **national income**, **price indices**, **output**, **consumption**, **inflation**, **saving**, **investment**, **energy**, **international trade**, and **international finance**.

In the following, I will follow the structure of *Macroeconomics by Gregory Mankiw*, widely regarded one of the best 
textbooks on intermediate level macroeconomic studies. My aim is to present these topics in a concise and digestible 
way, while still maintaining the key concepts and ideas.

## A brief history of modern macroeconomics

Macroeconomics in its modern form began with the publication of 
*General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by John Maynard Keynes*. When the Great Depression struck, classical 
economists had difficulty in explaining how goods could go unsold and workers could be left unemployed. In classical 
theory, prices and wages would drop until the market cleared, and all goods and labor were sold. Keynes offered a new 
theory of economics that explained why markets might not clear, which would evolve into a group of macroeconomic 
schools of thought known as **Keynesian economics** – also called *Keynesianism* or *Keynesian Theory*.

The generation following Keynes combined the macroeconomics of the General Theory with neoclassical microeconomics to 
create the **neoclassical synthesis**. By the 1950s, most economists had accepted the synthesis view of the 
macroeconomy. Economists like *Paul Samuelson*, *Franco Modigliani*, *James Tobin*, and *Robert Solow* developed formal 
Keynesian models and contributed formal theories of consumption, investment, and money demand that fleshed out the 
Keynesian framework.

*Milton Friedman* updated the quantity theory of money to include a role for money demand. He argued that the role of 
money in the economy was sufficient to explain the Great Depression, and that aggregate demand oriented explanations 
were not necessary. Friedman also argued that monetary policy was more effective than fiscal policy; however, Friedman 
doubted the government's ability to "fine-tune" the economy with monetary policy. He generally favored a policy of 
steady growth in money supply instead of frequent intervention.

**New classical macroeconomics** further challenged the Keynesian school. A central development in new classical 
thought came when *Robert Lucas* introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Prior to Lucas, economists had 
generally used adaptive expectations where agents were assumed to look at the recent past to make expectations about 
the future. Under rational expectations, agents are assumed to be more sophisticated. A consumer will not simply assume 
a 2% inflation rate just because that has been the average the past few years; they will look at current monetary 
policy and economic conditions to make an informed forecast. When new classical economists introduced rational 
expectations into their models, they showed that monetary policy could only have a limited impact.

**New Keynesian economists** responded to the new classical school by adopting rational expectations and focusing on 
developing micro-founded models. *Stanley Fischer* and *John B. Taylor* produced early work in this area by showing 
that monetary policy could be effective even in models with rational expectations when contracts locked in wages for 
workers. Other new Keynesian economists, including *Olivier Blanchard*, *Julio Rotemberg*, *Greg Mankiw*, 
*David Romer*, and *Michael Woodford*, expanded on this work and demonstrated other cases where inflexible prices and 
wages led to monetary and fiscal policy having real effects.

Like classical models, new classical models had assumed that prices would be able to adjust perfectly and monetary 
policy would only lead to price changes. New Keynesian models investigated sources of sticky prices and wages due to 
imperfect competition, which would not adjust, allowing monetary policy to impact quantities instead of prices.

By the late 1990s, economists had reached a rough consensus. The nominal rigidity of new Keynesian theory was combined 
with rational expectations to produce **dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models**. The fusion of elements 
from different schools of thought has been dubbed the new neoclassical synthesis. These models are now used by many 
central banks and are a core part of contemporary macroeconomics.
