**Quantitative** (or **algorithmic**) **trading** is the trading of securities based strictly on buy/sell decisions created by computer **algorithms**. These decisions are based on the **historical performance** of the strategy when tested versus **historical financial data**.

While this approach sounds similar to **technical analysis** in some respects, an important distinction between quantitative trading and technical analysis is the fact that not all technical analysis can be encoded or quantified into an algorithmic strategy. For example, a *head and shoulders* formation is a subjective notion and is not a quantifiable phenomenon. Furthermore, quantitative strategies are not limited to **technical data**, i.e. stock price charts. Quantitative strategies may incorporate a whole plethora of fundamental data sources, such as revenue numbers, cash flow, debt-to-earning ratios, etc.
