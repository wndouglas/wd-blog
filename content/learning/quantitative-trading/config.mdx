Quantitative trading is a form of market strategy that combines **mathematical** and 
**statistical models** to identify and execute opportunities. The models are created
and driven by **quantitative analysis**. Unlike traditional trading, pure quantitative
trading relies solely on the computer to inform its investment decisions.

In the following series of posts, I aim to introduce and delve quantitative/algorithmic
trading. My aim is to approach these topics in a way that should allow the reader to develop
their own quantitative trading system and strategies.
