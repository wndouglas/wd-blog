In my eyes, **interest rate modeling** is one of the most interesting areas of
mathematical finance. Interest rate (IR) models are more complex than their 
simple **equity** counterparts. In the IR world, the underlying variable is an 
entire term structure of interest rates, an unobservable quantity. Compare this 
to the equity world, where the underlying is often a single stock. IR models 
also lay claim to a **wider set of instruments**, both in the underlying and in 
the derivatives space. These instruments range from simple **government bonds** 
through to exotic derivatives such as **target redemption notes (TARNs)**. 
Accordingly, IR modeling lays claim to the most abundant theoretical literature 
on pricing and hedging, and a fascinating history of how these models came into
existence.

Beyond the theoretical merits of focusing on IR modeling, it's also the area
in which I work. I sit on the interest rates derivative trading desk at 
Barclays, building and extending in-house models that the desk use for pricing 
and risk management. Accordingly, I feel comfortable weighing in on the existing 
literature and research from the perspective of a practitioner. 

## The literature
The interest rate modeling literature is vast. There have been thousands of 
academic papers written in the field, from the early work of Fischer Black on 
the **Black model** of 1976 and the **Heath-Jarrow-Morton** framework of 1987, 
to the emergence of the **Libor Market Model** published in the work of Brace, 
Gatarek and Musiela in 1997. More recent developments include the **SABR 
volatility model**, published in a paper by Hagan, Kumar, Lesniewski and 
Woodward in 2002, and post-financial-crisis work on interest rate modeling 
under a **multi-curve framework**.

There a few **interest rate modeling books** that really stand-out in the field 
from a practitioner's point of view. These are:

1. Interest Rate Option Models, *Rebonato*
2. Interest Rate Models - Theory and Practice, *Brigo and Mercurio*
3. Interest Rate Modeling I, II & III, *Andersen and Piterbarg*

I've listed these in increasing order of quality and usefulness. In my eyes, the
Andersen and Piterbarg trilogy are all you could possibly need in order to start
and maintain a successful interest rate derivatives quant operation at a
professional level. In my work, I focus on these books, dipping into Brigo and
Mercurio whenever a more detailed look on some of the more technical aspects is
required.

Beyond these *big three* of the IR modeling literature, I highly recommend a 
couple of texts covering the more general **volatility modeling** space, these 
are

1. The Volatility Surface, *Gatheral*
2. The Volatility Smile, *Derman and Miller*
3. Dynamic Hedging, Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options, *Taleb*

## Tutorial structure
In the following, I will follow the structure of Andersen and Piterbarg's 
trilogy of interest rate modeling, assuming that a reader has a basic 
understanding of **stochastic calculus**, **Monte Carlo methods** and **PDEs**. 
My aim is to present these topics in a concise and digestible way, while still 
maintaining the key concepts and ideas. The structure of the tutorials is as 
follows:

**callable Libor Exotic**
* $\sigma_B(t,S;T,K)$: **Implied Black volatility smile**, parameterised by the 
time $t$ **spot** $S$, **strike** $K$ and **expiry** $T$
* $c_B(t,S; T, K, \sigma)$: Price of a **call option** in the **Black model** 
with time $t$ spot $S$, strike $K$, expiry $T$ and **Black volatility** $\sigma$
