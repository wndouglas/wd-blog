Fundamentally, the goal of an **interest rate model** is to describe the random movement of a curve of discount bond prices (known as the **term structure of interest rates**) through time, starting from a known initial condition. In actuality, only a few **short-dated** discount bonds are quoted **directly** at any given time. This is far from the continuous curve of discount bond prices up to a maturity of 20 or 30 years required as input in most IR models. However, as we have seen, there are a number of liquid securities whose values, in a no-arbitrage environment, depend in a straightforward fashion upon discount bonds. This allows the backing out of theoretical values for these bonds for maturities far beyond those that are quoted directly. Even so, only a finite set of securities are quoted in the market, so constructing a **continuous** curve of discount bond prices requires some assumptions of how the curve should act between observed points, i.e. an **interpolation rule** is required. This interpolation procedure may be based on direct assumptions of the functional form of the curve, or on some regularity norm to be optimised over.

This area is known as **discount curve construction**, and is a fundamental step in the modelling of fixed income products. Before the financial crisis of 07-08, it was standard to construct only a single discount curve based on **Libor rates**. However, since the crisis, it is no longer reasonable to assume that Libor rates are an accurate proxy for the OIS rates that underlie instruments such as vanilla swaps. It is hence necessary for a whole family of inter-related curves to be constructed in an unified manner. Nonetheless, it is crucial to understand single-curve construction before moving on to the construction of multiple curves. In this section, we explore the principles of single-curve construction, as used before the crisis.
