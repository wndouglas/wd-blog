With our basic arbitrage relationships in place, we can start to assign dynamics
to the major quantities we have defined so far. Specifically, we look at the
ZCB prices $P(t,T)$ and the instantaneous forward rate $f(t,T)$. By ensuring
that our dynamics do not admit arbitrage, we find that, in a universe where
our dynamics are dictated by a finite number of Brownian Motions, the dynamics 
of our various quantities must satisfy certain conditions. This is the *crux* of 
the **Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM)** framework. The HJM framework prescribes the way
in which the *drift* terms of our dynamics must relate to the *diffusion* terms
in order to satisfy no-arbitrage.

## Bond Price Dynamics
Within the HJM framework, we focus on modeling an entire continuum of $T$-indexed
bond prices $P(t,T)$ for $t \in [0,T]$, starting from the known initial conditions
$P(0,T)$. We consider ZCB prices over a finite time-horizon, 
i.e. $T \in [0, \mathcal{T}]$, $\mathcal{T} < \infty$, and assume that all
models are generated by a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion. Let $W(t)$ represent
a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$,
with numeraire $\beta(t)$, the continuously compounded money market account. 
Define the discounted ZCB prices $\tilde{P}(t,T) = \tfrac{P(t,T)}{\beta(t)}$. In
the absence of arbitrage $\tilde{P}(t,T)$ is a martingale under $\mathbb{Q}$,
and the martingale representation theorem then implies that
$$
    \text{d}\tilde{P}(t,T) = -\tilde{P}(t,T)\sigma_P(t,T)^\intercal\text{d}W(t),
$$
where $\sigma_P(t,T)$ is a $d$-dimensional stochastic process adapted to the
filtration generated by $W$. We assume that $\sigma_P(t,T)$ is regular enough for
$\tilde{P}(t,T)$ to be a **square-integrable** martingale, and since we have the
boundary conditions $P(T,T) = 1$ for $T \in [0,\mathcal{T}]$, we impose the extra
**pull to par** condition
$$
    \sigma_P(T,T) = 0.
$$
Considering the SDE for $\beta(t)$, using Ito's lemma shows that
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        & \frac{\text{d} P(t,T)}{P(t,T)} \\
        & = \frac{\text{d} \left(\beta(t)\tilde{P}(t,T) \right)}{P(t,T)} \\
        & = \frac{\tilde{P}(t,T)\text{d}\beta(t) + \beta(t)\text{d}\tilde{P}(t,T)}{P(t,T)} \\
        & = \frac{\text{d}\beta(t)}{\beta(t)} + \frac{\text{d}\tilde{P}(t,T)}{\tilde{P}(t,T)} \\
        & = r(t)\text{d}t -\sigma_P(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(t),
    \end{aligned}
$$
where $r(t)$ is the short rate. Equation
$$
    \frac{\text{d} P(t,T)}{P(t,T)} = r(t)\text{d}t -\sigma_P(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(t)
$$
defines the class of $d$-dimensional HJM models.

Another application of Ito's lemma shows that forward bond prices
$P(t,T,T+\tau) = \tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$ must satisfy
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        & \text{d}P(t,T,T+\tau) \\
        & = \text{d}\left(\frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}\right) \\
        & = \frac{\text{d}P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)} - \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)^2}\text{d}P(t,T) \\
        & \quad\quad - \frac{\text{d}\left\langle P(t,T), P(t,T+\tau) \right\rangle}{P(t,T)^2}\\
        & \quad\quad + \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)^3}\text{d}\left\langle P(t,T)\right\rangle \\
        & = \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}\cdot \\
        & \quad \left(\frac{\text{d}P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T+\tau)} -\frac{\text{d}P(t,T)}{P(t,T)} \right.\\
        & \quad\quad  \left. -\frac{\text{d}\left\langle P(t,T), P(t,T+\tau) \right\rangle}{P(t,T)P(t,T+\tau)} \right. \\
        & \quad\quad \left. + \frac{\text{d}\left\langle P(t,T)\right\rangle}{P(t,T)^2}\right) \\
        & = P(t,T,T+\tau) \cdot \\
        & \quad \left( -(\sigma_P(t,T+\tau) - \sigma_P(t,T))^\intercal \text{d}W(t)\right. \\
        & \quad \left. - \left( \sigma_P(t,T+\tau) - \sigma_P(t,T) \right)^\intercal \sigma_P(t,T) \text{d}t\right).
    \end{aligned}
$$

Hence, under the risk-neutral measure, forward bond prices satisfy the SDE
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \frac{\text{d}P(t,T,T+\tau)}{P(t,T,T+\tau)} \\
    & = -(\sigma_P(t,T+\tau) - \sigma_P(t,T))^\intercal \\
    & \quad\quad\quad (\sigma_P(t,T)\text{d}t + \text{d}W(t)).
\end{aligned}
$$
Since, under the $T$-forward measure $\mathbb{Q}^T$ $P(t,T,T+\tau)$ is a
martingale, it must be driftless under the $\mathbb{Q}^T$ measure, which
immediately shows that the $\mathbb{Q}^T$-Brownian motion is related to $W(t)$
via
$$
    \text{d}W^T(t) = \text{d}W(t) + \sigma_P(t,T)\text{d}t, \tag{4.1}
$$
so that by Girsanov's theorem, the density 
process $\eta(t) = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^T}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}} \right]$ 
for the measure shift between $\mathbb{Q}^T$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies
$$
    \frac{\text{d}\eta(t)}{\eta(t)} = -\sigma_P(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(t).
$$

## Instantaneous Forward Rate Dynamics
While the above fully specifies the HJM dynamics of the ZCB and forward bond
prices, the HJM framework is normally expressed in terms of the *instantaneous
forward rates*. Doing so eliminates the need to consider the short rate $r$
and also reveals a number of the fundamental properties of HJM models. By Ito's
lemma, under the risk-neutral measure, the quantity $Y(t,T) := \log P(t,T)$ satisfies
$$
    \text{d} Y(t,T) = - \sigma_P(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(t) + g(t,T)\text{d}t,
$$
for some function $g$ that we don't need to specify. Differentiating both sides
of the above SDE by $T$ and taking the partial differential inside the differential
term, we see that $f(t,T) = \tfrac{\partial Y(t,T)}{\partial T}$ satisfies SDE
$$
    \text{d}f(t,T) = \mu_f(t,T)\text{d}t + \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal\text{d}W(t),
$$
where
$$
    \sigma_f(t,T) = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \sigma_P(t,T). \tag{4.2}
$$
Using the relationship (4.1),we find that
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{d}f(t,T) & = \mu_f(t,T)\text{d}t \\
        & \quad + \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal(\text{d}W^T(t) - \sigma_P(t,T)\text{d}t) \\
        & = (\mu_f(t,T) - \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal \sigma_P(t,T))\text{d}t \\
        & \quad + \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W^T(t).
    \end{aligned}
$$
Since $f(t,T)$ is a $\mathbb{Q}^T$ martingale, the drift term must vanish.
Furthermore, integrating (4.2) with respect to T gives $\sigma_P(t,T) = \int_t^T \sigma_f(t,u)\text{d}u$.
These two results together show that
$$
    \mu_f(t,T) = \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal \int_t^T \sigma_f(t,u)\text{d}u.
$$
This is the **main result** of Heath, Jarrow and Morton. Once the forward rate
diffusion coefficients $\sigma_f(t,T)$ have been specified, the HJM model is
fully specified. The HJM models take initial forward rates $f(0,T)$ as *inputs*,
so that the models are automatically consistent with discount bond prices at
time $0$. This is true **irrespective** of the choice of $\sigma_f(t,T)$, which
can be set freely.

This automatic calibration to bond prices is the main selling point of HJM
models. However, there are a number of less desirable features of HJM models.
Particularly problematic is the **dimensionality** of the model. To describe bond
prices at some future time $t$, an entire continuum of forward rates $\{f(t,u): u \in [t,T]\}$.
In practice, to make this tractable requires either making assumptions on $\sigma_f$
that permits a finite-dimensional Markovian representation of the forward rate
curve, or moving to a finite state space model that tracks forwards rates
spanning time-buckets of finite length. This second approach is explored in much
more depth in the **Libor market model (LMM)**.

It's important to note that **any** arbitrage-free IR model set in a finite dimensional
Brownian motion world **must** be a special case of an HJM model. In particular,
any such model corresponds to a particular choice of $\sigma_f(t,T)$. So, in some
sense, the HJM framework underlies **all** of the models that we will cover.

## Short Rate Processes
In principle specification of the short-rate process is sufficient to completely
specify a full yield curve model. Under the HJM framework, it follows that the
short-rate $r(t)$ under $\mathbb{Q}$ satisfies
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        r(t) & = f(t,t) \\
        & = f(0,t) \\
        & \quad\quad + \int_0^t \sigma_f(u, t)^\intercal \int_u^t \sigma_f(u,s)\text{d}s \text{d}u \\
        & \quad\quad + \int_0^t \sigma_f(u, t)^\intercal \text{d}W(u).
    \end{aligned}
$$
Clearly the process $r(t)$ is **not** Markovian in general, as can be seen by
focusing on the term
$$
    D(t) = \int_0^t \sigma_f(u,t)^\intercal \text{d}W(u),
$$
for which we have
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        D(T) & = D(t) + \int_t^T \sigma_f(u,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(u) \\
        & \quad\quad + \left[\int_0^t \sigma_f(u,T)^\intercal \text{d}W(u) \right.\\
        & \quad\quad\quad \left. - \int_0^t \sigma_f(u,t)^\intercal \text{d}W(u) \right].
    \end{aligned}
$$
Unless the square-bracketed terms are either non-random, or a deterministic function
of $D(t)$, we find that
$$
    \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\left[D(T)\vert D(t)\right] \neq \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}[D(T)].
$$

## Examples of HJM Models
### The Gaussian Model
In the **Gaussian model**, we assume that 
$\sigma_P(t,T)$ is abounded deterministic function of $t$ and $T$. It follows 
that forward bond prices are then log-normal under both $\mathbb{Q}$ and 
$\mathbb{Q}^T$. The forward rate process under $\mathbb{Q}$ is
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{d}f(t,T) & = \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal \sigma_P(t,T)\text{d}t \\
        & \quad\quad + \sigma_f(t,T)^\intercal\text{d}W(t), \\
        \sigma_f(t,T) & = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \sigma_P(t,T),
    \end{aligned}
$$
which implies that $r(T)$ is Gaussian with $\mathbb{Q}$ moments
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[f(T,T) \right] & = \int_t^T \sigma_f(u,T)^\intercal \sigma_P(u,T) \text{d}u, \\
        \text{Var}_t^\mathbb{Q}(f(T,T)) & = \int_t^T \sigma_f(u,T)^\intercal \sigma_f(u,T)\text{d}u.
    \end{aligned}
$$

The Gaussian short-rate model benefits from being tractable and permitting
analytical price formulas for a number of European options and futures. It is
often a good starting point for the development of closed-form approximations in
other models. An example of a derivative admitting a closed-form solution under
the Gaussian model is an option on a ZCB:

##### Example (Option on a ZCB)
Consider a European call option with **maturity** $S$ and **strike** price $K$
on a $T$-bond. The payoff at time $S$ is given by
$$
    V(S) = (P(S,T) - K)^+, \quad S < T.
$$
In the Gaussian model, we have
$$
    V(t) = P(t, T)\phi(d_+) - K P(t, S)\phi(d_-),
$$
where
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        d_{\pm} & = \frac{\log\left(\frac{P(t,T)}{K P(t,S)}\right) \pm \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2}{\sigma} \\
        \sigma^2 & = \int_t^T \left\vert \sigma_P(u,T) - \sigma_P(u,S) \right\vert^2 \text{d}u.
    \end{aligned}
$$
This expression follows from the dynamics of $P(t,S,T)$ under $\mathbb{Q}^T$
after noting that $P(S,T) = P(S,S,T)$.

### Gaussian Models with Markovian Short Rate
Although tractable, the Gaussian model does **not** generally allow for a
finite-dimensional Markovian representation, and does not typically imply
**Markov** behaviour of the short rate. By considering the special choice
of *forward rate volatility*
$$
    \sigma_f(t,T) = g(t)h(T),
$$
where $h$ is a positive-valued real function and $g(t) \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
we can ensure that $r(t)$ *is* Markovian. In this case, we find that
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \sigma_P(t,T)& = \int_t^T \sigma_f(t,u)\text{d}u \\
    & = g(t) \int_t^T h(u)\text{d}u \tag{4.3}
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
    r(t) & = f(0,t) + h(t)\int_0^t m_f(t,u)\text{d}u \\
    & \quad\quad + h(t) \int_0^t g(u)^\intercal \text{d}W(u).\\ \tag{4.4}
\end{aligned}
$$
We find that the term
$$
\begin{aligned}
    D(t) & = \int_0^t \sigma_f(u,t)^\intercal\text{d}W(u) \\
    & = h(t)\int_0^t g(u)^\intercal \text{d}W(u)
\end{aligned}
$$
is Markov, since
$$
\begin{aligned}
    D(T) & = h(T)\int_0^T g(u)^\intercal \text{d}W(u) \\
    & = \frac{h(T)}{h(t)}D(t) + h(T)\int_t^T g(u)^\intercal\text{d}W(u).
\end{aligned}
$$
It quickly follows that $r(t)$ itself is Markovian by differentiating (4.4). In
fact, we have the following result.

##### Proposition (Markovian short rate)
*In the* $d$-*dimensional Gaussian HJM model, when* $(4.3)$ *holds, the short rate
satisfies an SDE of the form*
$$
    \text{d}r(t) = (a(t) - \xi(t)r(t))\text{d}t + \sigma_r(t)^\intercal\text{d}W(t),
$$
*where* $\xi(t) \in \mathbb{R}$ *and* $\sigma_r(t) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ *are deterministic
functions of time, and*
$$
    a(t) = \frac{\partial f(0,t)}{\partial t} + \xi(t)f(0,t) + \int_0^t \sigma_f(u,t)^\intercal \sigma_f(u,t)\text{d}u.
$$

### Log-Normal HJM Models
To avoid the issue of **negative forward rates** that arises in Gaussian HJM
models, it is tempting to consider forward rates of the form
$$
    \sigma_f(t,T) = f(t,T)\sigma(t,T),
$$
where $\sigma(t,T)$ is deterministic and bounded. In the $T$-forward measure,
$$
    \text{d}f(t,T) = f(t,T)\sigma(t,T)^\intercal \text{d}W^T(t),
$$
so that $f(t,T)$ is **log-normal**. This leads to **severe** issues. Under
$\mathbb{Q}$ we find that forward rates explode to infinity with non-zero
probability. Hence, all valuation formulas under $\mathbb{Q}$ lead to
ZCB prices being zero, implying obvious arbitrage opportunities.
