Crucial to the modeling of interest rate derivatives is the
**risk-neutral pricing** framework. This framework is expressed in the language 
of **stochastic processes** and two particularly important concepts are that of 
an **equivalent martingale measure** and a **numeraire**. In this post, we will
introduce the theory behind these concepts and then give some common and useful
measures.

## Risk-Neutral Pricing
In this section, we review the key results from **stochastic calculus** and
**modern asset pricing theory**. The results we uncover will give us a framework
for pricing assets in a way that is consistent with the idea of **no-arbitrage**,
a key assumption to mathematical finance. The following is *technical* and it is
*not* crucial that you understand the theory inside out. The only crucial result 
is that of the equivalent martingale measure and corresponding numeraire. Keep 
that in mind if you find this section too advanced.

### Setup
Consider an economy with **continuous** and **frictionless** trading, taking
place on a **finite time horizon** $[0,T]$. We assume the existence of $p$ traded,
**dividend-free** assets, whose prices are characterized by the vector-valued
**stochastic process** $X(t) = (X_1(t),\ldots, X_p(t))^\intercal$. Here, a
stochastic process is simply a continuous set of vector-valued random variables,
indexed by the *time* $t$. 

To model **uncertainty** and the **flow of information**,
we introduce a **probability space** $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. Here,
$\Omega$ is a **sample space** with elements $\omega$ representing states of the
world (or outcomes) that may materialise. $\mathcal{F}$ represents a specific
$\sigma$-**algebra** on $\Omega$ (we will later see which one), effectively a family
of subsets of outcomes from $\Omega$ that satisfies certain conditions. $\mathbb{P}$
represents a **probability measure** on the measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$.
The details of the above setup require an understanding of the field of
**measure theory**. Again, it is not important you understand this thoroughly. 
Just know that for each $A \in \mathcal{F}$ we find that $A \subset \Omega$ and 
that $\mathbb{P} : A \in \mathcal{F} \rightarrow [0, 1]$, i.e. $\mathbb{P}$ is a
function that takes sets of outcomes and **maps** them to a number between 0 and
1 in such a way that each of these mappings can be considered a **probability**
and $\mathbb{P}$ can be considered a probability measure.

We model the flow of information through time via a **filtration** 
$\mathbb{F} = \{\mathcal{F}(t) : t \in [0,T]\}$, a family of **sub**-$\sigma$-**algebras** of
$\mathcal{F}$ satisfying $\mathcal{F}(s) \subset \mathcal{F}(t) \subset \mathcal{F}$
whenever $s \le t$. The best way to think about $\mathcal{F}(t)$ is as the
information available at time $t$. As time passes, more and more information is
revealed, so that $\mathcal{F}(t)$ incorporates all of the previous information
up to time $s \le t$, plus any additional information gained from $s$ to $t$.

We will assume that the process $X(t)$ is **adapted** to $\mathcal{F}(t)$ for all
$t$. Technically, this means that for all 
$a \mathbb{R}$, $X(t)^{-1}((-\infty, a]) \in \mathcal{F}(t)$. Practically, this
just means that $X(t)$ is fully observable at time $t$. Finally, we require that
the filtration $\mathbb{F}$ satisifes the **usual conditions**, which I will leave
to the interested reader to explore further.

Let $\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[\cdot]$ represent the **expectation** operator for the
measure $\mathbb{P}$. When **conditioning** on information up to time $t$, we will
use the notation 
$\mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{P}[\cdot] := \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[\cdot \vert \mathcal{F}(t)]$.

The above setup is fairly flexible. For our purposes, we focus on the situation
where information is completely governed by a $d$-dimensional vector-valued 
**Brownian Motion** $W(t) = (W_1(t),\ldots,W_d(t))^\intercal$, where $W_i$ is
independent of $W_j$ for all $i \neq j$. Again, it is *not* important to understand
the technical details of Brownian motion on any particularly deep level. For now 
it suffices to say: $W(0) = 0$, $W_i(t) - W_i(s) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$ for
$t \ge s$ and that each of these increments are **independent** of one another
for non-overlapping times.

Above, we mentioned that $\mathcal{F}$ represents a specific $\sigma$-algebra on
$\Omega$. In fact, it is the one **generated** by $W$, i.e., for all $t$ we have
$\mathcal{F}(t) = \sigma \left(\{W(u), u \in [0,t] \} \right)$ 
and $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(T)$.

We will assume that $X(t)$ is described by the vector-valued **Ito process**
$$
    \text{d}X(t) = \mu(t,\omega)\text{d}t + \sigma(t,\omega)\text{d}W(s), \tag{2.1}
$$
where $\mu(s,\omega) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and $\sigma(t,\omega)\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times d}$
are both themselves $\mathbb{F}$ adapted processes.

An incredibly powerful and useful concept that we require for our framework is
that of a **martingale**. Before giving the precise definition, I will note that
the concept of a martingale is *really* a simple one. It just says that if a 
process is a martingale, then the best guess for where the process will be in 
the future is where it is today. In this way, it represents a **fair game**, in 
the sense that if the martingale's current value represented the cost of 
entering into a bet, and it's future value your payoff from the bet, then you 
would on average expect to come out flat from playing the game.

##### Definition (Martingale)
*Let* $Y(t)$ *be an adapted vector-valued process with* $\mathbb{E}^P\left[\left\vert Y(t) \right\vert\right] < \infty$
*for all* $t \in [0,T]$. *We say that* $Y(t)$ *is a martingale under the measure*
$\mathbb{P}$ *if, for all* $0 \le s \le t \le T$,
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{P}[Y(s)] = Y(t), \quad \text{a.s.}
$$

The second important concept that we require is known as **Ito's Lemma**. Ito's
lemma is really just a stochastic version of the **differential of a function**.
If we consider a simple scalar-valued function $f(x,y)$ then the standard
differential of $f$ is clearly just given by
$$
    \text{d}f(x,y) = \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} \text{d}x + \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} \text{d} y.
$$
This follows as the first order limit to the Taylor expansion
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta f(x,y) & = \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} \Delta x + \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} \Delta y \\
    & \quad \quad + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \Delta x^2 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2} \Delta y^2 \\
    & \quad\quad + \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \Delta x \Delta y + \text{H.O.T.}
\end{aligned}
$$
where H.O.T. represents the *higher-order terms* in the expansion, 
$\Delta f = :f(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y) - f(x,y)$ and $\Delta x, \Delta y > 0$.

This is all well and good while $x$ and $y$ are *deterministic*. If we were
to assume that $x = t$ was our deterministic time variable, but $y = X(t)$ was
some stochastic variable of the form (2.1), then we have a different story. The
notion of a differential breaks, since our higher order terms are no longer
*well-behaved*. In particular, we have $(\text{d}X(t))^2 = \sigma(t,\omega)^2 (\text{d}W(t))^2 + \text{H.O.T.}$,
where it can be shown that $(\text{d}W(t))^2 = \text{d}t$ in **quadratic mean**.
Thus, we see that in the first order limit, the stochastic case leads to
differential
$$
\begin{aligned}
   & \text{d} f(t,X(t)) \\
    & = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \text{d} t + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(\mu(t,\omega)\text{d}t + \sigma(t,\omega)\text{d}W(t)) \\
    & \quad + \frac{1}{2} \sigma(t,\omega)^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \text{d}t \\
    & = \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} +\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\right)\text{d}t \\
    & \quad\quad + \sigma \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \text{d}W(t).
\end{aligned}
$$
Ito's Lemma extends this result to *scalar-valued functions* of multiple variables.

##### Theorem (Ito's Lemma)
*Let* $f(t,x)$, $x = (x_1,\ldots,x_p)^\intercal$, *denote a continuous function, let*
$f(t,x) \in \mathbb{R}$ *for all* $t \in [0,T]$, $x \in \mathbb{R}^p$, *and let*
$f \in C^{1,2}([0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^p)$. *Let* $X(t)$ *be given by (1) and define
a scalar process* $Y(t) := f(t,X(t))$. *Let* $\nabla_x f$ *represent the* $p$-*dimensional
vector of partial derivatives of* $f$ *with respect to the non-time variables. Likewise,
let* $H_x f$ *represent the Hessian of* $f$ *with respect to the same variables*.
*Then* $Y(t)$ *is an* **Ito process** *with stochastic differential given by*
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \text{d} Y(t) \\
    & = \frac{\partial f(t,X(t))}{\partial t} \text{d} t + \nabla_x f(t,X(t)) \mu \text{d} t \\
    & \quad + \nabla_x f(t,X(t)) \sigma \text{d}W(t) \\
    & \quad + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^\intercal H_x f(t,X(t)) \sigma \text{d}t.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Trading Gains and Arbitrage
We now consider an **investor** engaging in a trading strategy involving the $p$
assets $X_1,\ldots,X_p$. Let the trading strategy be characterized by a 
**predictable** adapted process $\phi(t,\omega) = (\phi_1(t,\omega), \ldots, \phi_p(t,\omega))^\intercal$,
with $\phi_i(t,\omega)$ denoting the holding at time $t$ in the $i$th asset
$X_i$. The value $\pi(t)$ of the trading strategy at time $t$ is thus given by
$$
    \pi(t) = \phi(t) \cdot X(t).
$$
Clearly, over a small time interval $[t,t+\delta]$, the gain from trading is given
by $\phi(t) \cdot (X(t+\delta) - X(t))$, suggesting that
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \phi(t)\cdot \text{d} X(t) \\
    & = \phi(t) \cdot \mu(t)\text{d}t + \phi(t) \cdot \sigma(t)\text{d}W(t),
\end{aligned}
$$
is an appropriate model for **trading gains** in an infinitesimal interval. 

A trading strategy $\pi$ is said to be **self-financing** if, for 
any $t \in [0,T]$,
$$
    \text{d}\pi(t) = \phi(t) \cdot \text{d} X(t).
$$
This relationship expresses the concept that changes in portfolio value are solely
caused by trading gains or losses, with no funds being added or withdrawn.

##### Definition (Arbitrage)
*An* **arbitrage opportunity** *is a self-financing strategy* $\phi$ *for which*
$\pi(0) = 0$ *and, for some* $t \in [0,T]$,
$$
    \pi(t) \ge 0 \text{ a.s.} \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbb{P}(\pi(t) > 0) > 0.
$$

In a well-functioning market, arbitrage opportunities cannot exist, and precluding
arbitrage will form a key requirement for all of the asset processes that we will
consider.

### Equivalent Martingale Measures, Complete Markets and Arbitrage
Currently, the idea of an arbitrage opportunity is an abstract one that bears no
relation to the rest of our setup. However, one of the key insights of modern
asset pricing is that under certain conditions, we can encapsulate no-arbitrage 
via the concept of an **equivalent martingale measures**.

First, note that two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\hat{\mathbb{P}}$
on the same measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ are **equivalent** if
$\mathbb{P}(A) = 0 \iff \hat{\mathbb{P}}(A) = 0$ for all $A \in \mathcal{F}$. Shown
via the **Radon-Nikodymn Theorem**, two equivalent measures are connected through a
process $R$ with $\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[R] = 1$ such that 
$\hat{\mathbb{P}}(A) = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[R 1_A]$ for all $A \in \mathcal{F}$,
known as the **Radon-Nikodym derivative**. $R$ is often denoted 
by $\tfrac{\text{d}\hat{\mathbb{P}}}{\text{d}\mathbb{P}}$. Now, an equivalent
martingale measure for the process $Z(t)$ is simply an equivalent measure 
$\hat{\mathbb{P}}$ such that under $\hat{\mathbb{P}}$, $Z(t)$ is a martingale.

With these concept in place, we now introduce the important concept of 
a **numeraire**. 

##### Definition (Numeraire)
*A numeraire is a traded asset (a linear combination of our* $p$ *assets) 
with strictly positive price that pays no dividends, used to normalise the asset
process. Denoting the numeraire value at time* $t$ *by* $N(t)$, *the normalized 
asset process is given by* $X^N(t) := \tfrac{X(t)}{N(t)}$.

We say that a measure $\mathbb{Q}^N$ is an **equivalent martingale measure
induced by** $N$ if $X^N(t)$ is a martingale under $\mathbb{Q}^N$. We call a
trading strategy $\phi$ **permissible** if
$$
    \int_0^t \phi(s)^\intercal \text{d} X^N(s),
$$
is a martingale under $\mathbb{Q}^N$.

The last concept that we introduce is that of a **complete market**. Roughly, a
complete market is one where the assets $X(t)$ are the only ones that *matter*,
in the sense that all other assets can be generated as a linear combination of 
the $X_i$s.

##### Definition (Complete Market)
*A complete market is one in which all finite-variance* $\mathcal{F}(T)$-*measurable
random variables* $V(T)$ *can be* **replicated**, *in the sense that there exists 
a* **permisible** *trading strategy* $\phi$ *such that* $V(T) = \phi(T) \cdot X(T) = \pi(T)$. 

Via the **fundamental theorems of asset pricing**, we are now in a position to
link all of these concepts, in a way that gives us a practical way of **pricing
derivatives**.

##### Theorem (The Fundamental Theorems of Asset Pricing)
*Restricting attention to permissible trading strategies, the following two
equivalencies hold*:
1. *Our economy is arbitrage-free if and only if for each numeraire* $N$, 
*there exists at least one equivalent martingale measure* $\mathbb{Q}^N$.
2. *An arbitrage-free market is complete if and only if for each numeraire* $N$,
*the risk neutral measure* $\mathbb{Q}^N$ *is unique*.

Using the above, if we assume that our market is both arbitrage-free and complete
then for each numeraire $N$, there is a corresponding equivalent martingale measure
$\mathbb{Q}^N$. Hence, we can unambigously talk about the **numeraire, measure pair**
$(N,\mathbb{Q}^N)$. Under this pair, any $T$-maturity **derivative security**
paying out the random payoff $V(T)$ at time $T$ can be expressed via
$$
    \frac{V(t)}{N(t)} = \mathbb{E}_t^N\left[\frac{V(T)}{N(T)} \right],
$$
or
$$
    V(t) = N(t) \mathbb{E}_t^N \left[ \frac{V(T)}{N(T)} \right],
$$

where $\mathbb{E}_t^N[\cdot] := \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}^N}[\cdot \vert \mathcal{F}(t)]$.

Clearly, since $N$ is arbitrary in the above, if have another numeraire pair $(M, \mathbb{Q}^M)$ then
$$
    N(t) \mathbb{E}_t^N \left[ \frac{V(T)}{N(T)} \right] = M(t) \mathbb{E}_t^M \left[ \frac{V(T)}{M(T)} \right].
$$
If we consider the time $T$ payoff $V(T) = Y(T)M(T)$ then this shows that
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^N \left[ \frac{N(t) M(T)}{N(T) M(t)} Y(T) \right] = \mathbb{E}_t^M \left[Y(T) \right],
$$
By comparison, this shows that the Radon-Nikodym derivative for the measure change
between measures $\mathbb{Q}^N$ and $\mathbb{Q}^M$ is characterized by the process
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \eta(t) & = \mathbb{E}_t^N \left[ \tfrac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^M}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^N}\right] \\
    & = \frac{M(t)/M(0)}{N(t)/N(0)}. \tag{2.2}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Girsanov's Theorem
We have established that there is a close link between the concept of
arbitrage and the existence and uniqueness of an equivalent martingale measure.
We saw that there is even an easy way to characterize the Radon-Nikodym
derivative linking two equivalent martingale measures via their corresponding
numeraires. From a practical perspective, this does not tell us a huge amount
about how we convert our asset price dynamics when acting under different
numeraires. However, in the setup that we have introduced above, there *is* a
practical way of switching between measures.

Consider two measures, $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{P}(\theta)$ related by the
density $\eta^\theta(t) = \mathbb{E}_t^{\mathbb{P}}\left[\tfrac{\text{d}\mathbb{P}(\theta)}{\text{d}\mathbb{P}} \right]$,
where $\eta^\theta(t)$ is an **exponential martingale** given by the Ito process
$$
    \text{d}\eta^\theta(t) = -\eta^\theta(t)^\intercal \text{d}W(t).
$$
The $d$-dimensional process $\theta$ is known as the **market price of risk**.
Assuming that $\eta^\theta$ defines a martingale, we have the following important result:

##### Theorem (Girsanov's Theorem)
*Suppose that* $\eta^\theta(t)$ *defined above is a martingale, then for all*
$t \in [0, T]$
$$
    W^\theta(t) = W(t) + \int_0^t \theta(s) \text{d}s
$$
is a Brownian motion under the measure $\mathbb{P}(\theta)$.

## Fixed Income Probability Measures
As we have seen, selecting an equivalent martingale measure is largely a matter
of choosing a numeraire. Here, we go through a number of important numeraires
used in fixed income pricing. Throughout, we assume that our market precludes
arbitrage and is complete, and we use $V(t)$ to denote the time $t$ price of a
derivative security making an $\mathcal{F}(T)$-measurable payment of $V(T)$.

### The Risk Neutral Measure
The most fundamental numeraire in the fixed-income world (and even more 
generally in derivatives pricing) is the **continuously compounded money market
account** $\beta(t)$, satisfying the locally deterministic SDE
$$
    \text{d}\beta(t) = r(t)\beta(t)\text{d}t, \quad \beta(0) = 1,
$$
where $r(t)$ is the same short rate that we saw in Section 1. Solving this SDE
shows that
$$
    \beta(t) = \exp\left(\int_0^t r(s) \text{d} s\right). \tag{2.3}
$$
We denote the equivalent martingale measure associated with $\beta$ 
by $\mathbb{Q}$. Under this measure, we find that
$$
    V(t) = \beta(t)\mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\frac{V(T)}{\beta(T)} \right], \quad t \le T.
$$
Utilising the explicit formula (2.3), we find that the above is equivalent to
$$
    V(t) = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\exp\left(-\int_t^T r(s)\text{d}s\right)V(T) \right]. \tag{2.4}
$$
As we saw in the Section 1, a ZCB pays out 1 unit at its maturity $T$. Hence, if
we set $V(T) = 1$ then $V(t) = P(t,T)$ for $t \le T$ and we arrive at the
bond pricing formula
$$
    P(t,T) = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\exp\left(-\int_t^T r(s)\text{d}s\right)\right]. \tag{2.5}
$$
This result is important because it shows that specification of the dynamics of
the short-rate $r(t)$ under $\mathbb{Q}$ is enough to determine ZCB prices at all
times and maturities. Models based on such a direct specification are known as
**short rate models**. Note the similarity between (2.5) and (1.1). Clearly, if
$r(t)$ is deterministic then the two expressions will agree and $r(u) = f(t,u)$
for all $u \ge t$. However, if $r(t)$ is random, these two results diverge, and
we find that $f(t,u) \neq \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}[r(u)]$. However, if we were to
replace $f(t,u)$ by the equivalent futures rate $q(t,u)$ then the above *does*
hold. The exact result goes as follows.

##### Lemma
*Assuming that mark-to-market takes place continuously, under regularity 
conditions on* $r$, *futures rate* $F(\cdot, T, T+\tau)$ *is a* 
$\mathbb{Q}$-*martingale, and*
$$
    F(t,T,T+\tau) = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}[L(T,T,T+\tau)].
$$

Proving this result is relatively simple. We exploit the fact that
the mark-to-market process leads to daily cash proceeds 
proportional to $\text{d}F(t,T,T+\tau) = F(t+\text{d}t, T, T+\tau) - F(t,T,T+\tau)$. Deflating
each of these back to the current time $t$ and noting that the futures value is 
always zero shows that holding the futures contract until an arbitrary 
time $s \in [t,T]$ leads to the expression 
$V(t) = 0 = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\int_t^s \beta(s)^{-1} \text{d}F(s,T,T+\tau) \right]$.
Since this holds for arbitrary time horizons, we deduce that
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\text{d}F(s, T, T+\tau) \right] = 0, \quad s \in [t,T],
$$
which implies that $F$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-martingale. The result follows 
immediately.

Taking the limit as $\tau \searrow 0$ on both sides of the above then gives our
result for the instantaneous futures rate, i.e.
$$
    q(t,u) = \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}[r(u)].
$$

### The T-Forward Measure
The $T$-**forward** measure $\mathbb{Q}^T$ uses the $T$-bond as numeraire. We will denote the
conditional expectation operator under the $T$-forward measure by $\mathbb{E}_t^T[\cdot]$,
so that
$$
\begin{aligned}
    V(t) & = P(t,T)\mathbb{E}_t^T\left[ \frac{V(T)}{P(T,T)} \right] \\
    & = P(t,T)\mathbb{E}_t^T\left[ V(T) \right]. \tag{2.6}
\end{aligned}
$$

By comparing (2.4) and (2.6), it should be clear that switching from the
risk-neutral to the $T$-forward measure *decouples* the expectation of the
discount factor $D(t,T) := \tfrac{\beta(t)}{\beta(T)}$ from the expectation of the
payoff $V(T)$. This is often convenient when pricing IR derivatives. From
equation (2.2), we see that the change of measure process from the risk-neutral 
to the $T$-forward measure is given by density
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^\mathbb{Q}\left[\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^T}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}} \right] = \frac{P(t,T)/P(0,T)}{\beta(t)}.
$$
Since the $(T+\tau)$-bond is another traded asset and has price $P(t,T+\tau)$,
we find that by definition, the time $t$ forward bond price $P(t,T, T+\tau) = \tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$
is a martingale under the $T$-forward measure. This is, in fact, where the name
$T$-*forward* measure comes from.

While the forward bond price $P(t, T, T+\tau)$ is a martingale under the $T$ 
forward measure, we find that the forward *Libor rate* $L(t,T,T+\tau)$ is a
martingale under the $(T+\tau)$-forward measure $\mathbb{Q}^{T+\tau}$.
This follows immediately from the relation
$$
    L(t,T,T+\tau)=\frac{1}{\tau}\left(\frac{P(t,T)}{P(t,T+\tau)} - 1\right).
$$
Using this fact, we find that
$$
\begin{aligned}
    f(t,u) & = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} L(t, u, u + \tau) \\
    & = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \mathbb{E}_t^{u + \tau}[L(u, u, u + \tau)] \\
    & = \mathbb{E}_t^u [f(u,u)] \\
    & = \mathbb{E}_t^u[r(u)],
\end{aligned}
$$
a result analogous to that of the futures rate result under the risk-neutral
measure.

### The Spot Measure
When working on a full tenor structure $0 = T_0 < \cdots < T_N$ of forward rates,
it can be inconvenient to work with a particular forward measure $T_n$. Evolving
through time, once $t > T_n$, our numeraire is invalidated and we must switch
measure to one that is still *live*. Another way to avoid this issue is by
introducing a numeraire that extends to arbitrary horizons by construction. While
the *money market account* $\beta$ accomplishes this, it can be awkward to work
with an inherently *continuous* construct when dealing with a *discrete* tenor
structure. An alternative is the *discrete-time* equivalent to $\beta$.

At time $0$, we invest £$1$ in $\tfrac{1}{P(0,T_1)}$ $T_1$-bonds. Clearly, at
$T_1$, this investment returns
$$
    \frac{1}{P(0,T_1)} = 1 + \tau_0 L(0,0,T1).
$$
Reinvesting (**rolling**) this amount at $T_1$ into $T_2$-bonds then returns
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \frac{1}{P(0,T_1)}\cdot\frac{1}{P(T_1,T_2)} = \\
    &\quad (1 + \tau_0 L(0,0,T_1))(1 + \tau_1 L(T_1,T_1,T_2))
\end{aligned}
$$
at $T_2$. While $t \in (T_1, T_2]$, this investment clearly has value
$\frac{1}{P(0,T_1)}\cdot\frac{P(t,T_2)}{P(T_1,T_2)}$. By repeating this strategy 
at each date in the tenor structure, we arrive at an investment with time $t$ 
value $B(t)$ given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
    B(t) & = \prod_{i = 0}^n (1 + \tau_0 L_i(T_i))P(t,T_{n+1}), \\
    & \quad\quad t \in (T_n, T_{n+1}],
\end{aligned}
$$
where we have again used the shorthand $L_n(t) = L(t,T_n,T_{n+1})$.

Since we constructed $B(t)$ through a permissible trading strategy and $B(t) > 0$
for all $t$, $B(t)$ is a valid numeraire. The measure generated by $B(t)$ is called
the **spot (Libor) measure**, denoted by $\mathbb{Q}^B$ with associated conditional
expectation $\mathbb{E}_t^B[\cdot]$. Then
$$
    V(t) = \mathbb{E}_t^B\left[ V(T) \frac{B(t)}{B(T)}\right],
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{B(t)}{B(T)} & = \frac{P(t,T_{n+1})}{P(T,T_{k+1})} \prod_{i = n+1}^k \frac{1}{1 + \tau_k L_k(T_k)}, \\
    & \quad\quad t \in (T_n, T_{n+1}], T \in (T_k,T_{k+1}].
\end{aligned}
$$
It is clear that the spot measure resembles the risk neutral measure, since the 
risk-neutral measure is in some sense its continuous counterpart. In fact, if 
the futures rate is marked-to-market discretely, on dates $T_0,\ldots,T_N$, it 
turns out to be a martingale under the spot measure.

### Terminal and Hybrid Measures
The big advantage of the spot measure that we discussed was that it remains alive
throughout the span of the tenor structure. This property is key for valuing
securities which may mature at any date in the tenor structure (e.g. barriers
or range accruals).

Clearly, picking the $T$-forward measure corresponding to the *final* maturity
in the tenor structure, i.e. $T = T_N$ also satisfies this neat property. The
measure induced by $P(t,T_N)$, $\mathbb{Q}^N$ is called the **terminal measure**.
As usual,
$$
    V(t) = P(t,T_N)\mathbb{E}_t^N\left[\frac{V(T)}{P(T,T_N)} \right].
$$
One interpretation of the term $\tfrac{V(T)}{P(T,T_N)}$ is a the time $T_N$
proceeds of rolling the payoff $V(T)$ into the $T_N$-bond. Alternatively, we
could roll $V(T)$ into the spot numeraire asset $B(T)$, leading to $T_N$
payoff $V(T) \cdot \tfrac{B(T)}{B(T_N)}$. This gives rise to the equivalent
formula
$$
    V(t) = P(t,T_N)\mathbb{E}_t^N\left[V(T) \frac{B(T_N)}{B(T)} \right].
$$
Clearly, this idea generalises. For instance, we can define a numeraire such as
$$
    \hat{P}(t,T) :=
    \begin{cases}
        P(t,T), & t \le T, \\
        \tfrac{B(t)}{B(T)}, & t > T.
    \end{cases}
$$
This asset corresponds to the strategy of initially investing into the $T$-bond
and then rolling our proceeds into the spot measure at $T$. Letting $\hat{\mathbb{Q}}^T$
denote the corresponding measure with conditional expectation operator $\hat{\mathbb{E}}_t^T$, we can write
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        V(t) & = \hat{P}(t,T) \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t^T\left[ \frac{V(T_N)}{\hat{P}(T_N, T)} \right] \\
        & = \hat{P}(t,T)\hat{\mathbb{E}}_t^T \left[V(T_N) \frac{B(T)}{B(T_N)}\right], \\
        & \quad \quad T < T_N, t < T_N.
    \end{aligned}
$$
The associated measure to such numeraire is known as a **hybrid measure**. Clearly,
many such hybrid measures exist and can be useful for different situations.

### Swap Measures
Since the annuity factor $A_{k,m}(t)$ of Section 1 is just a linear combination
of ZCBs, it qualifies as a numeraire asset. The associated measure $\mathbb{Q}^{k,m}$
is known as a **swap measure** or **annuity measure**. We have
$$
    V(t) = A_{k,m}(t) \mathbb{E}_t^{k,m}\left[\frac{V(T)}{A_{k,m}(T)} \right],
$$
where $\mathbb{E}_t^{k,m}[\cdot]$ denotes the expectation operator under $\mathbb{Q}^{k,m}$.

In the absence of arbitrage, the forward swap rate $S_{k,m}(t)$, which we have
seen is defined by
$$
    S_{k,m}(t) = \frac{P(t,T_k) - P(t,T_{k+m})}{A_{k,m}(t)}
$$
is clearly a martingale under $\mathbb{Q}^{k,m}$, giving the measure its
name.
