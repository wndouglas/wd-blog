The archetypal fixed income security is the **bond**. A bond is an instrument
of indebtedness of the **issuer** to the **holder**. The holder pays an upfront
fee to the issuer in exchange for a series of pre-determined future 
**cash-flows**. Hence, the issuer borrows money *now* in order to finance their 
needs, and pays the holder back across the lifetime of the bond along with 
**interest**. **Governments** and **corporations** both borrow money by issuing 
bonds, utilising the upfront fees buyers pay for the instrument in order to
finance their activities.

The fundamental object we consider is that of a **zero-coupon bond (ZCB)**. A
ZCB makes a single payment, at the so-called **maturity** date of the bond.
In contrast to a standard **coupon bond**, where interest payments are made 
throughout the lifetime of the bond, the interest paid on a ZCB is entirely 
*baked-into* the market price of the instrument. At its maturity, the holder 
receives the **par** (or **face**) value of the bond. 

While there are large and liquid markets for zero-coupon bonds, for example 
**US Treasury bills (T-bills)** for short-term bonds, we shall see that in a
liquid and well-functioning market, the prices of longer-term term ZCBs can be
**extracted** from the prices of more liquid, coupon bearing bonds.

Hence, our analysis of ZCB prices is primarily theoretical, and in the following
we will assume the existence of a **continuous** set of ZCB prices for a large
range of maturities.

## Bonds and Forward Rates
Zero-coupon bonds make a single payment at their maturity date $T$. For ease of
calculation, we **normalise** this payment to 1 unit of currency, and refer to 
a ZCB with maturity $T$ as a $T$-**bond**. Since I'm a proud Brit, unless 
otherwise specified, we will assume a base currency of **Pound sterling**, Â£.

##### Definition (T-Bonds)
*A ZCB of maturity $T$ (or $T$-bond) is a contract paying 1 unit of currency on
the maturity date $T$. We will denote its value at the 
time $t \in [0,T]$ by $P(t, T).$*

The next fundamental quantity that we are interested in is that of a 
**forward rate**. To get to this, we introduce the concept of a **forward bond**.
The best way to motivate this concept is through an example.

Suppose we are interested in purchasing, at some future time $T$, a ZCB maturing
at $T + \tau$, $\tau > 0$. Today, at time $t < T$, the price of such a bond can
be **locked in** as follows:

1. Today, purchase one $(T+\tau)$-bond for $P(t, T+\tau)$.
2. To finance the purchase of the $(T+\tau)$-bond, sell 
**short** $\tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$ $T$-bonds. This strategy has no upfront
cost, since
$$
    -1 \cdot P(t, T+\tau) + \left( \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)} \right)\cdot P(t,T) = 0.
$$

Despite costing nothing to setup, a flow of $-\tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$ will
take place at time $T$ due to the maturity of our $T$-bond position. Likewise,
a flow of $1$ will take place at time $T+\tau$ due to our position in
the $(T+\tau)$-bond. In other words, our strategy **fixes** the time $T$
price of the $(T+\tau)$ bond at

$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) := \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)},
$$

a quantity known as the time $t$ **forward price** for the ZCB spanning $[T, T+\tau]$.

##### Definition (Forward bond)
*The time $t$ price for a forward bond with expiry date $T$ into a bond with
maturity date $T+\tau$, $\tau > 0$ is given by $P(t,T, T+\tau)$.*

Often, it is convenient to characterize a forward bond price by a **discount rate**.
There are numerous ways to do this, but one is the **continuously compounded forward yield**
$y(t,T,T+\tau)$, defined implicitly by

$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) = \exp\left( -y(t,T,T+\tau) \tau \right).
$$

##### Definition (Continuously compounded forward yield)
*The time $t$ value for the continuously compounded forward yield corresponding 
to the forward bond price for the interval $[T,T+\tau]$ is given 
by $y(t,T,T+\tau)$.*

The time between the expiry of the forward contract and the maturity of the
underlying bond, $\tau$, is often called the **tenor** of the forward bond or
forward yield. 

The above yield is motivated by the idea that the issuer of the
ZCB invests their proceeds into a continuously compounding
account. The time scaling $\tau$ term in the exponential above ensures that 
yields are **comparable** across tenors, making yields a useful metric for 
comparing different ZCBs.

Most actual market quotes, however, are based on **discrete-time compounding**
of proceeds. Accordingly, we define a **simple forward rate** $L(t,T,T+\tau)$ as

$$
    1 + \tau L(t,T,T+\tau) = \frac{1}{P(t,T,T+\tau)}.
$$

##### Definition (Simple forward rate)
*The time $t$ value for the simple forward rate corresponding to the forward 
bond price for the interval $[T,T+\tau]$ is given by $L(t,T,T+\tau)$.*

Again, $\tau$ is the tenor of the forward rate. For an arbitrary set of dates
$T = T_0 < T_1 <\cdots < T_n$, define the tenor structure $\left\{ \tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\right\}$
by $\tau_i := T_i - T_{i-1}$. Notice that the forward bond prices can be
recovered from the forward rates by simple compounding:

$$
    \frac{P(t,T_n)}{P(t,T)} = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1 + \tau_i L(t,T_{i-1},T_{i-1} + \tau_i)}.
$$

We will always assume that the **spot rates** $L(t,T) := L(t, t, T)$, $t \le T$
are the **Libor rates** quoted in the **interbank market**. Libor rates are
quoted on values of $\tau = T - t$ ranging from one week ($\tau = \tfrac{1}{52}$)
all the way through to 12 months ($\tau = 1$). Spot Libor rates are incredibly
important in the **interest-rate derivatives** market. They form the benchmark
for a number of instruments, such as **interest rate swaps** and 
**Eurodollar futures**. 

Note that for a number of reasons, the market is currently in the process of
*transitioning* away from Libor to the so called **risk free rates (RFRs)**:
**Sterling Overnight Interbank Average (SONIA)** and **Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR)**
in the UK and the US respectively.

Another important quantity is known as the **instantaneous forward rate** at time
$T$, denoted by $f(t,T)$. This quantity can be seen as the forward rate at time 
$t$ for the infinitesimal interval $[T, T+ \text{d}T]$. Hence, it is given by

$$
    f(t,T) := \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} L(t,T,T+\tau).
$$

##### Definition (Instantaneous forward rate)
*The time $t$ value for the instantaneous forward rate corresponding to the 
forward bond price for the infinitesimal interval $[T,T+\text{d}T]$ is given by 
$f(t,T)$.*

Using the definition of $L(t,T,T+\tau)$ and simple calculus we see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f(t,T) & = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \frac{1}{\tau}\left( \frac{1 - P(t,T,T+\tau)}{P(t,T,T+\tau)} \right) &\\
    & =  \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \frac{1}{\tau}\left( \frac{P(t,T) - P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T+\tau)} \right) &\\
    & = -\frac{1}{P(t,T)} \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \left( \frac{P(t,T+\tau) - P(t,T)}{\tau} \right) & \\
    & =  -\frac{1}{P(t,T)} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} P(t,T) & \\
    & = - \frac{\partial \log P(t,T)}{\partial T}. &
\end{aligned}
$$

Integrating both sides and taking exponentials shows that
$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) = \exp \left( - \int_T^{T+\tau} f(t,u) \mathop{du} \right).
$$

By comparison with the continuously compounded yield formula we also have

$$
    y(t,T,T+\tau) = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_T^{T+\tau} f(t,u) \mathop{du}, \tag{1}
$$

or, upon using the *mean value theorem*,

$$
    f(t,T) = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} y(t,T,T+\tau).
$$

Finally, by multiplying both sides of (1) by $\tau$ and differentiating, we see
have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f(t,T) & = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} y(t,t,T)(T-t) \\
    & = y(t,t,T) + (T-t)\frac{\partial}{\partial T} y(t,t,T).
\end{aligned}
$$

The quantity $r(t) := f(t,t)$ is another important quantity in the interest rate
modeling world. It is known as the **short rate** and is an $\mathcal{F}(t)$-
measurable random variable. Loosely speaking, $r(t)$ can be thought of as the
overnight rate at time $t$.

##### Definition (Short rate)
*The instantaneous forward rate at time $t$ for the infinitesimal 
interval $[t,t+\text{d}t]$ is known as the short rate and is given by*

$$
    r(t) := f(t,t).
$$
