The archetypal fixed income security is the **bond**. A bond is an instrument
of indebtedness of the **issuer** to the **holder**. The holder pays an upfront
fee to the issuer in exchange for a series of pre-determined future 
**cash-flows**. Hence, the issuer borrows money *now* in order to finance their 
needs, and pays the holder back across the lifetime of the bond along with 
**interest**. **Governments** and **corporations** both borrow money by issuing 
bonds, utilising the upfront fees buyers pay for the instrument in order to
finance their activities.

The fundamental object we consider is that of a **zero-coupon bond (ZCB)**. A
ZCB makes a single payment, at the so-called **maturity** date of the bond.
In contrast to a standard **coupon bond**, where interest payments are made 
throughout the lifetime of the bond, the interest paid on a ZCB is entirely 
*baked-into* the market price of the instrument. At its maturity, the holder 
receives the **par** (or **face**) value of the bond. 

While there are large and liquid markets for zero-coupon bonds, for example 
**US Treasury bills (T-bills)** for short-term bonds, we shall see that in a
liquid and well-functioning market, the prices of longer-term term ZCBs can be
**extracted** from the prices of more liquid, coupon bearing bonds.

Hence, our analysis of ZCB prices is primarily theoretical, and in the following
we will assume the existence of a **continuous** set of ZCB prices for a large
range of maturities.

## Bonds and Forward Rates
Zero-coupon bonds make a single payment at their maturity date $T$. For ease of
calculation, we **normalise** this payment to 1 unit of currency, and refer to 
a ZCB with maturity $T$ as a $T$-**bond**. Since I'm a proud Brit, unless 
otherwise specified, we will assume a base currency of **Pound sterling**, Â£.

##### Definition (T-Bonds)
*A ZCB of maturity $T$ (or $T$-bond) is a contract paying 1 unit of currency on
the maturity date $T$. We will denote its value at the 
time $t \in [0,T]$ by $P(t, T).$*

The next fundamental quantity that we are interested in is that of a 
**forward rate**. To get to this, we introduce the concept of a **forward bond**.
The best way to motivate this concept is through an example.

Suppose we are interested in purchasing, at some future time $T$, a ZCB maturing
at $T + \tau$, $\tau > 0$. Today, at time $t < T$, the price of such a bond can
be **locked in** as follows:

1. Today, purchase one $(T+\tau)$-bond for $P(t, T+\tau)$.
2. To finance the purchase of the $(T+\tau)$-bond, sell 
**short** $\tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$ $T$-bonds. This strategy has no upfront
cost, since
$$
   P(t, T+\tau) + \left( \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)} \right) P(t,T) = 0.
$$

Despite costing nothing to setup, a flow of $-\tfrac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)}$ will
take place at time $T$ due to the maturity of our $T$-bond position. Likewise,
a flow of $1$ will take place at time $T+\tau$ due to our position in
the $(T+\tau)$-bond. In other words, our strategy **fixes** the time $T$
price of the $(T+\tau)$ bond at

$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) := \frac{P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T)},
$$

a quantity known as the time $t$ **forward price** for the ZCB spanning $[T, T+\tau]$.

##### Definition (Forward bond)
*The time $t$ price for a forward bond with expiry date $T$ into a bond with
maturity date $T+\tau$, $\tau > 0$ is given by $P(t,T, T+\tau)$.*

Often, it is convenient to characterize a forward bond price by a **discount rate**.
There are numerous ways to do this, but one is the **continuously compounded forward yield**
$y(t,T,T+\tau)$, defined implicitly by

$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) = \exp\left( -y(t,T,T+\tau) \tau \right).
$$

##### Definition (Continuously compounded forward yield)
*The time $t$ value for the continuously compounded forward yield corresponding 
to the forward bond price for the interval $[T,T+\tau]$ is given 
by $y(t,T,T+\tau)$.*

The time between the expiry of the forward contract and the maturity of the
underlying bond, $\tau$, is often called the **tenor** of the forward bond or
forward yield. 

The above yield is motivated by the idea that the issuer of the
ZCB invests their proceeds into a continuously compounding
account. The time scaling $\tau$ term in the exponential above ensures that 
yields are **comparable** across tenors, making yields a useful metric for 
comparing different ZCBs.

Most actual market quotes, however, are based on **discrete-time compounding**
of proceeds. Accordingly, we define a **simple forward rate** $L(t,T,T+\tau)$ as

$$
    1 + \tau L(t,T,T+\tau) = \frac{1}{P(t,T,T+\tau)}.
$$

##### Definition (Simple forward rate)
*The time $t$ value for the simple forward rate corresponding to the forward 
bond price for the interval $[T,T+\tau]$ is given by $L(t,T,T+\tau)$.*

Again, $\tau$ is the tenor of the forward rate. For an arbitrary set of dates
$T = T_0 < T_1 <\cdots < T_n$, define the tenor structure $\left\{ \tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\right\}$
by $\tau_i := T_i - T_{i-1}$. Notice that the forward bond prices can be
recovered from the forward rates by simple compounding:

$$
    \frac{P(t,T_n)}{P(t,T)} = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1 + \tau_i L(t,T_{i-1},T_{i-1} + \tau_i)}.
$$

We will always assume that the **spot rates** $L(t,T) := L(t, t, T)$, $t \le T$
are the **Libor rates** quoted in the **interbank market**. Libor rates are
quoted on values of $\tau = T - t$ ranging from one week ($\tau = \tfrac{1}{52}$)
all the way through to 12 months ($\tau = 1$). Spot Libor rates are incredibly
important in the **interest-rate derivatives** market. They form the benchmark
for a number of instruments, such as **interest rate swaps** and 
**Eurodollar futures**. 

Note that for a number of reasons, the market is currently in the process of
*transitioning* away from Libor to the so called **risk free rates (RFRs)**:
**Sterling Overnight Interbank Average (SONIA)** and **Secured Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR)**
in the UK and the US respectively.

Another important quantity is known as the **instantaneous forward rate** at time
$T$, denoted by $f(t,T)$. This quantity can be seen as the forward rate at time 
$t$ for the infinitesimal interval $[T, T+ \text{d}T]$. Hence, it is given by

$$
    f(t,T) := \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} L(t,T,T+\tau).
$$

##### Definition (Instantaneous forward rate)
*The time $t$ value for the instantaneous forward rate for the infinitesimal
interval $[T,T+\text{d}T]$ is given by $f(t,T)$.*

Using the definition of $L(t,T,T+\tau)$ and simple calculus we see that

$$
\begin{aligned}
    & f(t,T) \\
    & = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \frac{1}{\tau}\left( \frac{1 - P(t,T,T+\tau)}{P(t,T,T+\tau)} \right) &\\
    & =  \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \frac{1}{\tau}\left( \frac{P(t,T) - P(t,T+\tau)}{P(t,T+\tau)} \right) &\\
    & = -\frac{1}{P(t,T)} \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} \left( \frac{P(t,T+\tau) - P(t,T)}{\tau} \right) & \\
    & =  -\frac{1}{P(t,T)} \frac{\partial}{\partial T} P(t,T) & \\
    & = - \frac{\partial \log P(t,T)}{\partial T}. &
\end{aligned}
$$

Integrating both sides and taking exponentials shows that
$$
    P(t,T,T+\tau) = \exp \left( - \int_T^{T+\tau} f(t,u) \mathop{du} \right). \tag{1.1}
$$

By comparison with the continuously compounded yield formula we also have

$$
    y(t,T,T+\tau) = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_T^{T+\tau} f(t,u) \mathop{du}, \tag{1.2}
$$

or, upon using the *mean value theorem*,

$$
    f(t,T) = \lim_{\tau \searrow 0} y(t,T,T+\tau).
$$

Finally, by multiplying both sides of (1.2) by $\tau$ and differentiating, we see
have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f(t,T) & = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} y(t,t,T)(T-t) \\
    & = y(t,t,T) + (T-t)\frac{\partial}{\partial T} y(t,t,T).
\end{aligned}
$$

The quantity $r(t) := f(t,t)$ is another important quantity in the interest rate
modeling world. It is known as the **short rate** and is an $\mathcal{F}(t)$-
measurable random variable. Loosely speaking, $r(t)$ can be thought of as the
overnight rate at time $t$.

##### Definition (Short rate)
*The instantaneous forward rate at time $t$ for the infinitesimal 
interval $[t,t+\text{d}t]$ is known as the short rate and is given by*

$$
    r(t) := f(t,t).
$$

## Futures Rates
A quantity closely related to the forward rate is the **futures rate**. Through
the **Eurodollar futures market**, investors can enter into a security paying
$$
    1 - L(T,T,T+\tau), \tag{1.3}
$$
at time $T$. At inception, i.e. time 0, a **Eurodollar futures contract** can be
entered into for no upfront cost, but with the implicit obligation of the holder
paying
$$
    1 - F(0,T,T+\tau),
$$
per unit of notional at time $T$, in return for the payout (1.3). Here, the 
quantity $F(t,T,T+\tau)$ is known as the **simple futures rate** at time $t$ for 
the period $[T,T+\tau]$.

##### Definition (Simple futures rate)
*The time $t$ value for the simple futures rate for the interval $[T,T+\tau]$ 
is given by $L(t,T,T+\tau)$.*

The important difference between a forward and a futures contract is that the
futures rate is **marked to market** each day, meaning that the day's change in 
the futures rate is immediately credited (or debited) from the contract holder's
account with the futures exchange. This difference is in place to mitigate the 
credit risk associated with either party in the contract defaulting on their
payments and leads to differences in the modeling of futures relative to 
forwards. Specifically, after holding the contract for a period of $\Delta = 1$
day, the futures contract holder would experience a cash flow of
$$
    \begin{aligned}
         (1 - F(\Delta, T, & T+\tau)) - (1-(F(0,T,T+\tau))) \\
        & = -(F(\Delta,T,T+\tau) - F(0,T,T+\tau)).
    \end{aligned}
$$
Continuing this process to maturity, denoting day $i$ by $\Delta_i$, the futures 
holder receives a cumulative cash-flow of
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        & -\sum_{i=1}^n (F(\Delta,T,T+\tau) - F(0,T,T+\tau)) \\
        & = -(F(T,T,T+\tau) - F(0,T,T+\tau)) \\
        & = F(0,T,T+\tau) - L(T,T,T+\tau),
    \end{aligned}
$$
where we have used the fact that $F(T,T,T+\tau)$ must equal $L(T,T,T+\tau)$ to
avoid **delivery arbitrage** (if they were not, we could enter the
futures contract at maturity and immediately make a profit (or loss)) by selling
the underlying.

As with forward rates, we can define the **instantaneous futures rate** $q(t,T)$ 
via:

$$
    q(t,T) = \lim_{\tau searrow 0} F(t,T,T+\tau).
$$

##### Definition (Instantaneous futures rate)
*The time $t$ value for the instantaneous futures rate for the infinitesimal
interval $[T,T+\text{d}T]$ is given by $q(t,T)$.*

## Annuity Factors and Par Rates
In contrast to ZCBs, most fixed income securities involve multiple cash-flows
taking place on a predetermined schedule of dates, referred to as a
**tenor structure**, $0 \le T_0 \cdots < T_N$. Given such a tenor structure, for
any two integers $k$ and $m$ satisfying $0 \le k < N$, $m > 0$ and $k + m \le N$,
we define the **annuity factor** $A_{k,m}$ by
$$
    A_{k,m}(t) := \sum_{n = k}^{k+m-1} \tau_n P(t,T_{n+1}), \quad \tau_n := T_{n+1} - T_n.
$$

##### Definition (Annuity factor)
*The time $t$ annuity factor for the tenor structure $0 \le T_0 \cdots < T_N$, with 
$k$ and $m$ satisfying $0 \le k < N$, $m > 0$ and $k + m \le N$ is given by
$A_{k,m}(t)$ as defined above.*

Annuity factors supply us with a compact way of expressing the price of
**coupon-bearing bonds**. For instance, if a coupon bond makes $m$ interest
payments, each of a value $c \tau_n$ and each paid at the time $T_{n+1}$ for
$n = k,\ldots,k+m-1$, we can consider each of these payments as a separate ZCB
scaled by notional $c \tau_n$, so the security has time $t$ value
$$
    \sum_{n = k}^{k+m-1} c \tau_n P(t,T_{n+1}) = c A_{k,m}(t).
$$
If the security also involves a final payment of **principal**, as is the case
for standard coupon-bearing bonds, the coupon bearing bond has time $t$ price
$$
    c A_{k,m}(t) + P(t,T_{k,m}),
$$
where the bond has been normalized to pay unit notional. The time $t$ forward
price for expiry $T_k$ is then given by
$$
    \frac{c A_{k,m}(t)}{P(t,T_k)} + P(t,T_k, T_{k+m}).
$$
The value of the coupon payment $c$ for which this expression is at **par**, i.e.
1 is known as the **forward par rate**, or, when used in the context of swap
pricing, as the **forward swap rate**. Denoting this quantity by $S_{k,m}(t)$
and rearranging gives
$$
    S_{k,m}(t) := \frac{P(t,T_k) - P(t,T_{k+m})}{A_{k,m}(t)}, \quad t \le T_k.
$$

##### Definition (Forward par/swap rate)
*The time $t$ forward swap rate for the tenor structure $0 \le T_0 \cdots < T_N$, 
with  $k$ and $m$ satisfying $0 \le k < N$, $m > 0$ and $k + m \le N$ is given by
$S_{k,m}(t)$* as defined above.

From the definition of the simple forward rate $L(t,T_n,T_{n+1})$ we then see
that the above can be rewritten as
$$
    \frac{\sum_{n=k}^{k+m-1}\tau_n P(t,T_{n+1}) L_n(t)}{A_{k,m}(t)}, \quad t \le T_k,
$$
where $L_n(t) := L(t,T_n, T_{n+1})$.

Hence, one interpretation of the forward swap rate is that it is simply a
weighted average of simple forward rates on the tenor structure. The time $T_k$
is often referred to as the **fixing date**, or **expiry** of the swap rate
$S_{k,m}$, while the length of the corresponding swap $T_{k+m} - T_k$ is often
called the **tenor** of the swap rate.
