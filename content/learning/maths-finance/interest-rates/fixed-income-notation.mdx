The archetypal fixed income security is the **bond**. A bond is an instrument
of indebtedness of the **issuer** to the **holder**. The holder pays an upfront
fee to the issuer in exchange for a series of pre-determined future cash-flows. 
Hence, the issuer borrows money *now* in order to finance their needs, and pays 
the holder back across the lifetime of the bond along with **interest**. 
**Governments** and **corporations** both borrow money by issuing bonds, 
utilising the upfront fees buyers pay for the instrument in order to finance 
their activities.

The fundamental object we consider is that of a **zero-coupon bond (ZCB)**. A
ZCB makes a single payment, at the so-called **maturity** date of the bond.
In contrast to a standard **coupon bond**, where interest payments are made 
throughout the lifetime of the bond, the interest paid on a ZCB is entirely 
*baked-into* the market price of the instrument. At its maturity, the holder 
receives the **par** (or **face**) value of the bond. 

While there are large and liquid markets for zero-coupon bonds, for example 
**US Treasury bills (T-bills)** for short-term bonds, we shall see that in a
liquid and well-functioning market, the prices of longer-term term ZCBs can be
**extracted** from the prices of more liquid, coupon bearing bonds.

Hence, our analysis of ZCB prices is primarily theoretical, and in the following
we will assume the existence of a **continuous** set of ZCB prices for a large
range of maturities.
