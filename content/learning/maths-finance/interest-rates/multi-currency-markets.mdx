Some derivatives depend on multiple currencies. If this is the case, the challenge
of modeling such derivatives becomes more difficult. In this section, we
introduce a framework for modeling such **multi-currency** derivatives.

## Notation
Consider a setup where we have two economies, a **domestic** economy and a
**foreign** economy, each with their own currency. In the following, we will
denote the domestic currency by £ (GBP) and the foreign currency by $ (USD). Note
that these choices of currencies are *arbitrary* and are just used for 
concreteness.

Let $P_d(t,T)$ and $P_f(t,T)$ denote the time $t$ prices of $T$-bonds in the 
domestic and foreign economies, respectively. Translating the value of the foreign
$T$-bond to the domestic currency can be achieved at time $t$ through the 
**spot FX rate** $X(t)$ measured in units of domestic currency per unit of
foreign currency. In other words, the value $\hat{P}_d(t,T)$ to a
domestic investor of one foreign $T$-bond is
$$
    \hat{P}_d(t,T) = X(t)P_f(t,T).
$$

## FX Forwards
For no initial cash outlay, it is possible to generate a guaranteed cashflow at 
time $T$ of one unit of foreign currency and $-X_T(t)$ units of domestic currency, 
where $X_T(t)$ represents the time $t$ value of the **forward FX rate** with 
maturity $T$. The strategy is as follows:
1. Buy one foreign $T$-bond for $\hat{P}_d(t,T)$ in domestic currency.
2. Finance this purchase by short-selling $\tfrac{\hat{P}_d(t,T)}{P_d(t,T)}$ 
units of the domestic $T$-bond.
Clearly, this strategy is free to enter, and will generate a time $T$ cashflow
of $\$1 - £\tfrac{\hat{P}_d(t,T)}{P_d(t,T)}$. To preclude arbitrage, we find that this
expression must be zero at time $t$. Hence, we have locked in an exchange rate of
$$
    X_T(t) := \frac{\hat{P}_d(t,T)}{P_d(t,T)} = X(t)\frac{P_f(t,T)}{P_d(t,T)}
$$
at time $t$ for an FX trade at maturity $T$.

## Risk Neutral Measures
Let $\beta_d(t)$ and $\beta_f(t)$ denote the continuously compounded money markets
in the domestic and foreign economies, respectively. $\beta_d(t)$ and $\beta_f(t)$
induce two separate risk-neutral measures, which we denote by $\mathbb{Q}^d$ and
$\mathbb{Q}^f$, respectively. Clearly, these two measures are *related*. If $g(T)$
is a random payoff at time $T$ made in the foreign currency, in a complete market
this payoff is worth
$$
    V_f(t) = \beta_f(t) \mathbb{E}_t^f \left[\frac{g(T)}{\beta_f(T)} \right],
$$
to the foreign investor, where $\mathbb{E}_t^f[\cdot]$ represents the conditional 
expectation operator under $\mathbb{Q}^f$. From the point of view of a domestic 
investor, the payoff $g(T)$ must translate to a domestic currency at a rate of 
$X(T)$ at time $T$, making the effective domestic payoff $g(T)X(T)$. Hence,
$$
    V_d(t) = \beta_d(t)\mathbb{E}_t^d \left[\frac{g(T)X(T)}{\beta_d(T)} \right],
$$
where $\mathbb{E}_t^d[\cdot]$ represents the same operator under $\mathbb{Q}^d$.
Importantly, to preclude arbitrage, we find that $V_f(t)$ and $V_d(t)$ must also
be linked by the spot rate. Specifically, we have
$$
    V_d(t) = X(t)V_f(t),
$$
or
$$
    \beta_d(t)\mathbb{E}_t^d \left[\frac{g(T)X(T)}{\beta_d(T)} \right] = X(t) \beta_f(t) \mathbb{E}_t^f \left[\frac{g(T)}{\beta_f(T)} \right].
$$
If we now consider the arbitrary payoff $Y(T) := \tfrac{g(T)X(T)}{\beta_d(T)}$,
the above shows that
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^d\left[ Y(T)\right] = \mathbb{E}_t^d\left[ Y(T) \frac{X(t)\beta_f(t)\beta_d(T)}{X(T)\beta_f(T)\beta_d(t)}\right].
$$
By our earlier theory, this shows that the density process linking $\mathbb{Q}^d$
and $\mathbb{Q}^f$ is given by
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^d \left[\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^f}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^d} \right] = \frac{\beta_f(t)X(t)}{\beta_d(t)X(0)}, \quad t \ge 0.
$$
Because we know that this density process is a martingale under $\mathbb{Q}^d$,
if $X(t)$ is to be an Ito process, it must take the form
$$
    \frac{\text{d}X(t)}{X(t)} = (r_d(t) - r_f(t))\text{d}t + \sigma_X(t)^\intercal \text{d}W(t),
$$
under $\mathbb{Q}^d$, i.e. its drift is completely determined by the **spread**
in the short-rates between the two economies.

## Other Measures
Heuristically, by using a relation analogous to the *chain rule* applied to Radon-Nikodym
derivatives, relations between other domestic and foreign probabilty measures
are easy to deduce. Suppose our desired numeraire is $N$, with values $N_d$ 
and $N_f$ in the domestic and foreign economies respectively. Denote the 
measures under these numeraires by $\mathbb{Q}^{N, d}$ and $\mathbb{Q}^{N, f}$
under the domestic and foreign currencies respectively. Then, we find that
$$
\begin{aligned}
    & \mathbb{E}_t^{N,d}\left[\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^{N,f}}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^{N,d}} \right] \\
    & = \frac{N_f(t)/N_f(0)}{\beta_f(t)}\cdot \frac{\beta_f(t)X(t)}{\beta_d(t)X(0)}\cdot\frac{\beta_d(t)}{N_d(t)/N_d(0)} \\
    & = \frac{N_f(t)X(t)N_d(0)}{N_f(0)X(0)N_d(t)}.
\end{aligned}
$$
In particular, if we set $N$ to be the $T$-bond in each currency, by noting the
formula for the FX forward rate we see that
$$
    \mathbb{E}_t^{T,d}\left[\frac{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^{T,f}}{\text{d}\mathbb{Q}^{T,d}} \right] = \frac{X_T(t)}{X_T(0)}.
$$
This also demonstrates the fact that $X_T(t)$ is a $\mathbb{Q}^{T,d}$-martingale
satisfying $X_T(T) = X(T)$.
