Mathematical finance is my area of focus at work and also my passion. My role as 
a desk quant at Barclays utilises many of the core topics in the area. In 
particular, **stochastic calculus** and **statistics**. My area of expertise is 
**interest rate modeling**, which encompasses many of the fundamental concepts 
due to the complexity and high-dimensionality of many of the products traded in 
the fixed income space.

To me, mathematical finance is fascinating because it builds upon many core areas
of maths in interesting and useful ways.

In the following series of posts, I aim to introduce and then delve into key 
areas in the mathematic finance space. My aim is to approach these topics with 
the spin of a practitioner - as someone who practices what he preaches.
