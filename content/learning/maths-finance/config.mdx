Mathematical finance is my area of focus at work and as well as the field of my 
graduate studies. My role as a desk quant at Barclays made use of the field 
extensively. My area of expertise is **interest rate modeling**, which encompasses 
many of the fundamental concepts of mathematical finance due to the complexity and 
high-dimensionality of many of the products traded in the fixed income space.

To me, mathematical finance is interesting because it builds upon many core areas
of maths in interesting and practical ways. In particular, it utilises 
**stochastic calculus**, **probability** and **statistics**.

In the following series of posts, I aim to introduce and delve into key areas within 
mathematical finance. My aim is to approach these topics with the spin of a 
practitioner - someone who practices what he preaches.
