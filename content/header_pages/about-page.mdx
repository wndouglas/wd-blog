Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Will, a young financial professional living and working in London. Whether it's maths and finance or my take on exercise, managing your money as a young professional or learning to code, this site serves as a home for my thoughts. I aim to produce both educational content aimed at graduates and students seeking roles in financial institutions, and more general articles I think are interesting.

### A bit about me
Back in July 2018, I graduated from the MSc in Mathematical and Computational Finance at the University of Oxford, a one year masters degree serving as a comprehensive overview and introduction to the world of quantitative finance. Since finishing at Oxford, I've been working on the trading floor at Barclays Investment Bank as a quantitative analyst. In particular, I help research, design and implement algorithms that allow our interest rates derivatives trading desk to price and analyse the risks involved in the trades they make.

Prior to my masters degree, I studied for the BSc in Mathematics at the University of Warwick, commencing in 2015 and graduating in 2018. While at Warwick I focused my studies heavily on mathematical analysis, probabilty, statistics and programming. I have experience working as both a software engineer and as a data scientist, and I remain keenly interested in both fields, especially with regards to their applications in finance and economics. 

Beyond the classroom/office, I maintain a strong passion for rugby and sport of all kinds, as well as exercise and fitness, having completed a half-marathon in 2018 and hopefully a few more races by the time you're reading this!
