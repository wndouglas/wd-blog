Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Will, a young financial professional living
and working in London. Whether it's maths and finance or my take on
managing your money as a young professional or learning to code, this site
serves as a home for my thoughts.

I aim to produce both educational content
aimed at graduates and students seeking roles in financial institutions, and
more general articles.

### My Background
Back in July 2018, I graduated from the MSc in Mathematical and Computational
Finance at Oxford University, a masters degree serving as a comprehensive
overview and introduction to the world of quantitative finance. 

Since finishing at Oxford, I've been working on the trading floor at Barclays
Investment Bank as a Quantitative Analyst. In particular, I research, design and
implement algorithms that allow our interest rates derivatives trading desk to
price and analyse the risks involved in their trades.

Prior to my masters degree, I studied the BSc in Mathematics at the
University of Warwick, graduating in 2018. While at Warwick I focused my studies
heavily on mathematical analysis, probabilty, statistics and programming.
 
I have experience working as both a software engineer and as a data scientist,
and I remain keenly interested in both fields, especially with regards to their
applications in finance and trading. 

Beyond the classroom/office, I have a strong passion for rugby and sport of
all kinds, as well as exercise and fitness, having completed a half-marathon
in 2018 and hopefully a few more races by the time you're reading this!

### Behind the Title
Aside from being a cheap and punchy domain I could get my hands on,
the title *Alpha Beta Rho* does have a meaning. In my line of work, we're
interested in modelling the dynamics of various different financial quantities.
One such quantity is known as a **forward price**. A vastly successful and well
known forward model used in the industry is the **Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho** 
model, named because of it's three governing Greek letter parameters: $\alpha$
(Alpha), $\beta$ (Beta) and $\rho$ (Rho).
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABR_volatility_model">Wikipedia</a>
for a more comprehensive overview of the model.
