In this series of posts, my aim is to give some some mini-tutorials on areas of maths that I think are both interesting and useful.
The main areas that I aim to cover are: **Linear Algebra, Analysis, Vector Analysis, Stochastic Analysis and PDE Theory**. I believe that these
are the main topics you should have a basic understanding of to be effective in any quantitative discipline (finance is no exception). If
you are familiar with these topics (even on a basic level), you can leverage your skills to do some really powerful stuff.  
There are hundreds of textbooks and web tutorials available for all of these topics, so my goal is not just to be another one of those, 
but to present each topic in a way that is easy to digest and highlights their practical importance from a finance point of view. While I'm absolutely
no expert on any of these areas, I have studied each of them at a post-graduate level, and have used them all extensively in my job and in projects at work.
