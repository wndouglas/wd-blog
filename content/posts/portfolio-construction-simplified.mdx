Starting an **investment portfolio** can be a daunting prospect. The breadth of assets to choose from is massive - from 
individual **equities** and **bonds** through to **actively managed funds** and **ETFs** - and it can be hard to know 
where to start. In this post, we seek to identify a suitable selection of assets to invest in - our **universe** of 
assets - and to **quantitatively** (and qualitatively) deduce the best possible weightings of each of these assets 
within a portfolio.

## The Case for Passive Funds/ETFs
In the 

## Minimising Your Costs
As Albert Einstein allegedly said: "Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, 
earns it. He who doesn't, pays it". Compound interest has the potential to be incredibly powerful if you get
yourself on the right side of the growth curve. Suppose you have $£100$ you wish to invest in a fictitious asset 
that gives you a guaranteed, risk-free compounded annual return of $10\%$. After $30$ years of holding this asset, 
your investment would be worth
$$
    £ 100 \times 1.1^{30} = £ 1745,
$$
representing a total return of $1645\%$ on your initial investment. However, if you were to add a percentage fee (this 
could be a brokerage cost enforced by your investment platform or a tax, such as capital gains tax) of just $2\%$ to 
this annually compounding return, your investment would instead be worth
$$
    £ 100 \times 1.08^{30} = £1006,
$$
representing a total net return of $996\%$. 

Clearly, fees and tax have the ability to significantly reduce your returns over the course of a long-term investment.
It is therefore **incredibly** important that you take these factors into consideration when you choose where to invest
your money. The first port of call (if you are a UK resident over the age of 18) should be to maximise your **ISA**
allowance. Your ISA (as of February $2021$) allows you to save (or invest) up to $£20,000$ per year in a **tax-free 
environment**, sheltering you from both capital gains and income tax on your investments. The other important consideration is to ensure that the **platform** or **broker** you are using both supports the use of ISAs, and charges you fees that you deem justifiable based on the service they provide.

## Picking a Platform
In the UK, there are many platforms that support the use of ISAs, including: **Hargreaves Lansdown**, **Vanguard 
Investor**, **AJ Bell** and **Fidelity**. Hargreaves Lansdown is routinely ranked the highest of all platforms by 
customers, despite their relatively high fees (e.g. $0.45\%$ on your first $£250,000$ invested on top of any fees 
levied by the fund manager themselves, though HL often have negotiated fee savings with their brokers). This is 
probably down to their slick and easy to use user interface and (supposedly) good customer service. Vanguard offers 
very low fees, but restricts investments to only Vanguard funds and ETFs, while AJ Bell offers some middle ground 
between Vanguard and HL, with lower fees than HL and better fund/ETF selection than Vanguard. My personal choice is to 
use Vanguard. As we saw in the previous section, costs are a huge factor in your overall success as an investor, and I 
personally feel that Vanguard offer enough of a variety in their funds and ETFs to make this saving more than 
worthwile. Any individual name investing/trading I may decide to do can be through one of the low-cost brokers out 
there like Trading 212 or Interactive brokers.

Vanguard levy their fees as follows: 

* **Account fee** - This is a fee charged on a yearly basis, applied across all Vanguard accounts you own - currently charged at $0.15\%$pa for accounts under $£250,000$ and capped at $£375$ thereafter.

* **Ongoing costs** - This fee is applied on a product by product basis, representing the cost of managing the product - currently, the ongoing cost on Vanguard investments averages $0.20\%$.

* **One-off/transaction costs** - A cost passed on from Vanguard to you, to cover the bid/ask spread in the case of ETFs, or the cost of buying/selling the underlying instruments in the case of funds - these range from $0.02\%-0.06\%$ in the case of funds to $0.02\%-0.23\%$ in the case of ETFs (as of September $2020$).

* **Dealing fees** - This fee represents the cost of entering or exiting a position - for funds there is zero dealing fee and for ETFs there is an optional (if you wish to deal on the live price) cost of $£7.50$ per trade.
