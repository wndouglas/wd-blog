If you're like me (an English or Welsh student who started an undergraduate 
degree anywhere in the UK on or after 1 September 2012 and you took out 
a student loan to help cover your fees), you probably find yourself with a 
significant student loan to your name. Most people I know have come to terms 
with this fact. They treat their loan as an additional *tax* that they will 
have to pay for 30 years after they start working. But is this the best strategy 
for everyone? In particular, after accounting for things like tax, NI 
contributions, rent and living costs, are you better off investing your leftover 
cash, or using some of it to make voluntary loan repayments.

By building a simple **repayment model**, we will investigate 
whether the passive strategy of letting the minimum repayment come out of your 
paycheck automatically is an effective strategy from an investment point of 
view, or whether a student loan holder is better off 
making **early repayment contributions**.

## Simplifying the Terms of the Loan
Looking at the student 
finance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance">website</a>, you're
presented by a confusing and messy page explaining how repayment works. In
reality, it's *not* that complicated. Here's how it works.

#### How repayment works

If, like me, your course started after 1 September 2012, you have a **Plan 2**
loan. This means that you will start repaying your loan the first **April** 
after you finish studying, and you will *only* pay anything if your current **gross**
income is over £26,575 a year (or £2,215) a month. You will then pay 9% 
of your gross income **in excess** of this threshold each payment period. If you are 
paid a monthly salary and you earn £2,315 per month, you would then repay 
9% of £2,315 - £2,215 = £100, which is £9 per month.

If you're looking at that £9 per month and thinking 'that doesn't seem like much,
I spend that much on Netflix', I'd firstly recommend jumping in on your parent's
Netlfix account, but I would also recommend **voluntary repayments**. You have 
the right to make extra contributions to your repayment on top of the automatic 
contribution at any time, provided that this payment is larger than £5.

Finally, if you still have an outstanding student loan after 30 years, your 
loan is **written off** and your 50 year old self can relax in the knowledge 
that the last trace of your naive student years is behind you.

#### How the interest works
It is important to realise here that even while you are studying, your loan is
accruing **interest**. While you study, your rate of interest is the UK RPI plus
3%. At the time of writing, UK RPI is at 2.4%. So if you are still studying you 
are paying 5.4% in interest.

Once you are eligible for repayment, you are charged an interest of RPI, plus
an extra sliding charge of between 0% for those earning £26,575 per year or less 
up to 3% for those earning over £47,835 per year. The exact way that the 
additional rate scales from 0% to 3% turns out to be incredibly difficult to 
find in the student finance documents. From a modelling perspective, we will
assume a linear scale between 0% and 3%.

An important detail that doesn't seem to get mentioned anywhere online or on
the student finance documents is the **interest rate schedule** of these interest
payments. According 
to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c56a3ee-60e4-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895">this</a>
article in the FT, the repayments are **monthly**, and **compound**. To me, this
is an egregious lack of transparency from the government. I spent the good part
of an hour searching for this information, and the only source I could find
was in a subscription newspaper that many students have no access to. The article
shares my view and states that the details of the interest payments is 'hidden in
the small print'. But I digress.

## Building the Model
In order to analyse various different strategies of repayment, it is important 
to lay down both some notation, and also some criteria for comparing approaches. 

#### Notation and framework
In the following, we will denote the **total outstanding debt** at the point of 
starting repayment by £$D$. For most students who studied a 3 year undergraduate 
degree after 1 September 2012 and took out a full tuition and maintenance loan,
this quantity will be in the region of £30,000. We denote the 
**total amount paid** towards the loan across its lifetime by £$P$.

Since interest payments and most professional's salaries are paid monthly,
we consider a debtor's **gross monthly salary**. In the $n$th month of repayment 
we will denote this by £$s(n)$ and we will denote the **total outstanding debt** 
in the same month by £$d(n)$. Clearly $d(0) = D$. We then denote the 
**automatic contributions** made towards the loan in the $n$th month by 
$p_a(n)$, and the **voluntary contributions** by $p_v(n)$, giving a 
**total contribution** in month $n$ of $p(n) := p_a(n) + p_v(n)$. Finally, we 
denote the interest accrued on the loan in the $n$th month by $i(n)$.

Next, we denote the **nominal annual rate** on the loan in month $n$ by $r(n)$. 
This is the headline figure of RPI plus an extra rate that we saw above. We
break this rate down into the sum of an **inflation linked component** $r_i(n)$,
and an additional, salary dependent component $r_a(n)$. Assuming a linear scale
between the lower and upper yearly salary thresholds of £26,575 and £47,835, 
which we denote by their equivalent monthly salary figures $l_i$ and $u_i$ 
respectively, we have

$$
r_a(n) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & s(n) < l_i, \\
\frac{0.03}{u_i-l_i}\left(s(n)- l_i\right), & l_i \le s(n) \le u_i, \\
0.03, & s(n) > u_i.
\end{cases}
$$

We then have

$$
r(n) = r_i(n) + r_a(n).
$$ 

Since the interest is charged monthly and is compound, we find that the interest
owed in month $n+1$ is given by

$$
i(n+1) = \frac{r(n)}{12} d(n).
$$

Furthermore, letting the lower repayment threshold be denoted by 
$l_r = £2215 = £26,575/12$, the automatic repayment contribution in month $n+1$ 
is given by

$$
p_a(n+1) =
\begin{cases}
0, & s(n) < l_r,\\
0.09(s(n) - l_r), & s(n) \ge l_r.
\end{cases}
$$

In the following, we will assume that $s(n) \ge l_r$ for each month $n$. It
seems unreasonable to attempt to model the best strategy of paying off your
student loan if you're aren't even earning enough to start paying it off in the
first place!

We're finally ready to give an expression for the outstanding debt at time $n+1$ 
in terms of the quantities in month $n$. This quantity is the sum of the debt 
in month $n$ and the interest accrued in month $n$, minus the payment made at 
the start of month $n+1$. Thus, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d(n+1) & = d(n) + i(n+1) - p(n+1) \\
    & = \left(1 + \frac{r(n)}{12}\right)d(n) - p(n+1).
\end{aligned}
$$

The mathematically inclined will notice that the above represents
a difference equation, the discrete time version of an ordinary differential
equation (ODE). If the repayment term $p(n+1)$ vanished, the above
would simply represent the discrete-time equivalent of an exponential growth 
model, just like any compound investment. All of this is a fancy way of saying 
that if your monthly repayments $p(n+1)$ are not sufficient to outpace the 
interest rate $r(n)$, then you will find yourself on the wrong side of an 
exponential growth curve, and you will *very* quickly find that your student 
debt blows so far out of proportion that early repayment becomes practically 
impossible.

The next step is to introduce another **risky asset or portfolio** with a 
(hopefully) positive return. We will denote the value of this asset in month $n$ 
by $X(n)$ and will assume throughout that this has a constant monthly 
compounding return of $\mu$, i.e. we have

$$
    X(n+1) = \left(1 + \frac{\mu}{12}\right)X(n),
$$

Without loss of generality, we will assume that $X(0) = 1$ so that

$$
    X(n) = \left(1 + \frac{\mu}{12}\right)^n.
$$

In our framework, we will assume that after all outgoings (including living 
costs), our remaining income that we have available to invest, $I(n)$, will be 
a proportion, $f(n) \in [0,1]$, of that months salary $s(n)$, i.e. 

$$
    I(n) = f(n) s(n).
$$

Before we can use this cash, the amount $p_a(n)$ is automatically removed, 
leaving us with $I(n) - p_a(n)$ left to invest.

Next, we need a measure of our **wealth** at time $n$, which we will denote
by $W(n)$. This value consists of the value of our holdings in the risky asset,
which is given by

$$
    W(n) = Q(n)X(n),
$$

where $Q(n)$ is the quantity of the asset that we hold at time $n$.

At each timestep $n$ we have the choice of investing our remaining 
income $I(n) - p_a(n)$ in the risky asset, or using our cash to make voluntary 
loan repayments. We use a proportion $x(n) \ge 0$ of this cash to make voluntary 
prepayments, i.e. 

$$
    p_v(n) = x(n)(I(n) - p_a(n)),
$$

and we invest the remainder in the risky asset, i.e. we invest 

$$
    I(n) - p_a(n) - p_v(n) = (1-x(n))(I(n) - p_a(n)),
$$

in the asset. Therefore, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    W(n+1) & = Q(n)X(n+1) + (1-x(n))(I(n) - p_a(n)) \\
     & = Q(n+1)X(n+1),
\end{aligned}
$$

so that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Q(n+1) & = Q(n) + \left(\frac{1-x(n)}{X(n+1)}\right)(I(n) - p_a(n)) \\
    Q(0) & = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$    

Our goal, then, is to find the optimal sequence of proportions $x(n) \ge 0$ to 
make early repayments with, in order to maximise our terminal wealth $W(N)$. 
Here, $N$ is the final month of repayment, i.e. the 360th month. At this time, 
our debt may or may not have already been written off via earlier repayments.

#### The optimal strategy
Now that we have the notation in place, it is easy to define a **repayment
strategy**. By repayment strategy, I refer to a sequence of additional
repayment contribution fractions $x(1),\ldots,x(N)$.

Our goal is then to find the sequence $x := (x(1),\ldots, x(N))$ that maximises
our terminal wealth, i.e. to find

$$
    \hat{x} := \argmax_{x} W(N; x).
$$

If we were to consider the problem in full generality, a naive optimisation 
would lead to a 360 dimensional problem. A reasonable simplification that will 
make our problem far more tractable is that of a **constant strategy**, i.e. 
strategies where $x(n) = x$ for all $n$. From a financial perspective, this 
strategy reflects many people's attitude towards investing. It represents a 
*set and forget* approach, where a fixed monthly loan repayment is automatically 
paid out.

There is an important extra consideration with this approach. If we have fully 
repaid our loan before the terminal date $N$, i.e. if $d(n) = 0$ for some $n$, 
then we **stop** our voluntary repayments, so if $k$ is the first index such 
that $d(k) = 0$ then we have

$$
    x(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        x, & n < k, \\
        0, & n \ge k.
    \end{cases}
$$

It is clear that there are two extreme approaches. The first is to pile all of 
our remaining income into voluntary prepayments. In this case we build up no 
investments until our loan is fully repaid, but as soon as the loan is written 
off we are able to maximally invest into the risky asset. The second is to make 
no voluntary prepayments. In this case we focus on building up our investment 
from the start, but have less cash to use to invest since we incur an automatic 
repayment for the longest possible period of time.

The problem is thus to deduce where the optimal strategy lies between these two 
extremes.

#### Assumptions
While the framework we have built above is fairly general and allows for a lot
of flexibility in the various different parameters, in order to generate useful
results that we can easily compare, we need to add some assumptions and 
constraints. The aim in this analysis is to give **ballpark figures** for the 
terminal wealth of different strategies, not exact values. The goal is that
the effectiveness of various strategies **relative** to one 
another is accurately modeled, not necessarily that the **absolute** values 
themselves are.

A few assumptions have already been *baked in*. One of these is that the maximum
additional interest rate one pays will always be 3% and that the upper and lower
thresholds will remain where they are. The government is capable of changing 
these figures and has done so periodically. Nonetheless, building a model to 
predict where these values are headed in the coming weeks and months is beyond 
the scope of this post, and would be of questionable utility anyway.

import RPI from '../../src/components/post_components/student_debt/rpiPhoto'

<RPI/>

Another assumption I believe is reasonable is that RPI will remain close to its 
historic average. The above plot shows RPI figures for the years 1990-2019. 
Observe that the values
tend to oscillate around a mean value of 3%. Hence, we will use an RPI of 3% in
our model. I would also argue that a precise estimate of the RPI figure is 
unnecessary. Any increase in RPI that leads to an increase in the 
rate charged on the loan *should* be offset by a corresponding increase in one's
salary.

The next assumption is perhaps the most restrictive but will be very useful
in terms of simplifying our model. We will assume that salary **raises occur 
monthly and at a constant nominal annual rate** of $a_m$. Of course normally 
people get raises occur once a year. There *will* be a slight difference in the 
results using monthly increases compared to yearly, but again, our purpose 
here is to come up with a tractable model. If a reasonable yearly increase is 
$a$, then we can convert this to a monthly rate $a_m$ via

$$
    a_m = 12\left(\left(1 + a\right)^{1/12} - 1\right).
$$

For example, if we assume a yearly raise of 5%, this would translate to a 
nominal annual raise of around 4.89%.

With this assumption, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    s(n) & = \left(1 + \frac{a_m}{12}\right)s(n-1) \\
    & = \left(1 + \frac{a_m}{12}\right)^{n}s(0) \\
    & = (1 + a)^{n/12} s(0).
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, specifying $a$ and $s(0)$ fully determines the sequence of salaries
$s(1),\ldots,s(N)$.

The final assumption we will use is that our disposable income, before accounting
for automatic loan repayments, is a **fixed** value, so that $f(n) \equiv f >= 0.09$.
This final constraint is just to ensure positivity of our disposable income. This
assumption seems reasonable. Tax and NI contributions scale relatively linearly with
income, and peoples living costs tend to increase in line with their incomes.

With these assumptions, we are ready to put our model to use. 

#### Implementation and results
With our framework in place, it was easy to implement the model in Python. If
you're interested, you can find the code 
on <a href="https://github.com/wndouglas/blog-projects/tree/master/student-debt">GitHub</a>.

In the following, the method was applied using the *sensible* values for the 
various parameters given above. 

Looking at UK average wage increases for the 
year of 2019, the national average rise was 3.6%. I think this is a conservative 
figure for an aspiring young professional, so we will use a value of $a = 0.05$.

In 2019, the average student entered repayment with a total student debt of
£36,000, so we will use $D = 36000$.

The average starting salary for a graduate beginning repayments in
**London** is £30,000 at the time of writing, so this is the value we will use as 
input to the model.

We will use a disposable income of 40% of ones gross salary as the parameter $f$.
I think this reflects a reasonable proportion once things like tax, National 
Insurance and living costs like rent are taken into account.

Finally, an average nominal annual return of 5% will be assumed. By concentrating
your investments on index funds, this is historically a pretty good return.
Clearly if you believe you can do better by generating a hand-picked portfolio,
or if you are willing to take on more risk, you should use a larger figure than
this.

import RepaymentPlots from '../../src/components/post_components/student_debt/repaymentPhoto'

<RepaymentPlots/>

Above, terminal wealth at the end of the 30 year period versus the proportion
of remaining disposable income used to make voluntary prepayments for various different
starting salary levels are plotted. The plots show that for starting
salaries below a threshold, one is better off **not** making voluntary 
prepayments. In other words, it is a better idea to take all of your disposable 
income and use it to invest prudentially across a well-diversified portfolio 
with a steady annual return. Beyond this threshold, it may be a better choice to
make steady voluntary repayments. The middle plot shows a blown up version of the case
of a starting salary of £40,000. Here we see that it is **slightly** more effective
to make voluntary repayments, and that the benefit of doing so tapers off at
around 50% of available income. Don't be misled by the vertical scaling of this plot,
it is still only a **minor** wealth increase.

In the bottom plot, the length of time to fully repay ones debt is
shown. Clearly, there is an exponential drop off in the time taken to repay
your full student loan once you do breach the *threshold* at which your loan is
not simply written-off after 30 years.

Upon reflection on these plots, it seems to me that with our assumptions, for
an individual earning a starting salary of £40,000 or over, it is a good idea to
invest a small percentage of your available income into voluntary repayments.
An investment of just 20% makes the most out of the steepest part of the 
terminal wealth curve and significantly deceases the time it takes for full
repayment of your student loan. This gives a good balance between paying off
your loan fast, allowing you to benefit from the halting of the automatic contributions
at an earlier point, while giving you cash to use from day 1 to potentially benefit
from riskier investments.

It is also important to consider **tax** implications of repaying ones loan.
In our analysis, we have neglected the important point that while the money 
we use to make early repayments is tax-free, the capital gains we make on our
investments are generally not. This might prompt us to place more
weight than our model would suggest on making early repayments.

#### Conclusions
Clearly, the model we have used is a simplification of reality. In the
real world, portfolio values rise and fall - they don't grow at a constant rate.
Furthermore, people's disposable incomes ebb and flow through different points of
the year.

It's also clear that restricting our proportion of remaining wealth, technically
our *control* variable, to constant values is another big simplification
(but one that probably reflects many people's *set and forget* mindset towards
setting up monthly loan repayments). A more advanced study might leverage the
power of Richard E. Bellman's dynamic programming principle, and the area of
**optimal control**. I think this could be an interesting application of the
**optimal stochastic control** framework, similar in vein to **Merton's portfolio
problem**.

For now, these extensions are beyond the scope of this analysis. Interesting
though they are from a technical perspective, my intuition tells me that the conclusion
will not change - **you are probably better off treating your student loan as
another tax**.
