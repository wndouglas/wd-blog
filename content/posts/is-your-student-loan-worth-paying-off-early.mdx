If you're like me (an English or Welsh student who started an undergraduate 
degree anywhere in the UK on or after 1 September 2012 and you took out 
a student loan to help cover your fees), you probably find yourself with a 
significant student loan to your name. Most people I know have come to terms 
with this fact. They treat their loan as an additional *tax* that they will 
have to pay for 30 years after they start working. But is this the best strategy 
for everyone? 

By building a simple **repayment model**, we will investigate whether the 
passive strategy of letting the minimum repayment come out of your paycheck 
automatically is an effective strategy from an investment point of view, or
whether a student loan holder is better off making **early repayment contributions**.

## Simplifying the Terms of the Loan
Looking at the student 
finance <a href="https://www.gov.uk/student-finance">website</a>, you're
presented by a confusing and messy page explaining how repayment works. In
reality, it's *not* that complicated. Here's how it works.

#### How repayment works

If, like me, your course started after 1 September 2012, you have a **Plan 2**
loan. This just means that you will start repaying your loan the first **April** 
after you finish studying, and you will *only* pay anything if your current **gross**
income is over £26,575 a year (or £2,214) a month. You will then pay 9% 
of your gross income **in excess** of this threshold each payment period. If you are 
paid a monthly salary and you earn £2,314 per month, you would then repay 
9% of £2,314 - £2,214 = £100, which is £9 per month.

If you're looking at that £9 per month and thinking 'that doesn't seem like much,
I spend that much on Netflix', I'd firstly recommend jumping in on your parents
Netlfix account, but I would also recommend **voluntary repayments**. You have 
the right to make extra contributions to your repayment on top of the automatic 
contribution at any time, provided that this payment is larger than £5.

Finally, if you still have an outstanding student loan after 30 years, your 
loan is **written off** and your 50 year old self can relax in the knowledge 
that the last trace of your naive student years is behind you.

#### How the interest works
It is important to realise here that even while you are studying, your loan is
accruing **interest**. While you study, your rate of interest is the UK RPI plus
3%. At the time of writing, UK RPI is at 2.4%. So while you are studying you 
pay 5.4% of interest.

Once you are eligible for repayment, you are charged an interest of RPI, plus
an extra sliding charge of between 0% for those earning £26,575 per year or less 
up to 3% for those earning over £47,835 per year. The exact way that the 
additional rate scales from 0% to 3% turns out to be incredibly difficult to 
find in the student finance documents. From a modelling perspective, we will
assume a linear scale between 0 and 3.

An important detail that doesn't seem to get mentioned anywhere online or on
the student finance documents is the **interest rate schedule** of these interest
payments. According 
to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c56a3ee-60e4-11e7-91a7-502f7ee26895">this</a>
article in the FT, the repayments are **monthly**, and **compound**. To me, this
is an egregious lack of transparency from the government. I spent the good part
of an hour searching for this information, and the only source I could find
was in a subscription newspaper that many students have no access to. The article
shares my view and states that the details of the interest payments is 'hidden in
the small print'. But, I digress.

## Building the Model
In order to analyse various different strategies of repayment, it is important 
to lay down both some notation, and also some criteria for comparing approaches. 

#### Notation
In the following, we denote the **total outstanding debt** at the point of 
starting repayment by $£D$. For most students who studied a 3 year undergraduate 
degree after 1 September 2012, this quantity will be in the region of £40,000. 
We denote the **total amount paid** towards the loan across its lifetime by $£P$.

Since both interest payments and most professional's salaries are paid monthly,
we consider a debtor's **gross monthly salary** in the $n$th month of repayment 
by $£s(n)$ and the **total outstanding debt** in the same month by $£d(n)$.
Clearly $d(0) = D$. We then denote the **automatic contributions** made towards 
the loan in the $n$th month by $p_a(n)$, and the **voluntary contributions** 
by $p_v(n)$, giving a **total contribution** in month $n$ 
of $p(n) := p_a(n) + p_v(n)$. Finally, we denote the interest accrued on the 
loan in the $n$th month by $i(n)$.

Next, we denote the **nominal annual rate** on the loan in month $n$ by $r(n)$. 
This is the headline figure of RPI plus an extra rate that we saw above. We
break this rate down into the sum of an **inflation linked component** $r_i(n)$,
and an additional, salary dependent component $r_a(n)$. Assuming a linear scale
between the lower and upper yearly salary thresholds of £26,575 and £47,835, 
which we denote by their equivalent monthly salary figures $l_i$ and $u_i$ 
respectively, we have

$$
r_a(n) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & s(n) < l_i, \\
\frac{0.03}{u_i-l_i}\left(s(n)- l_i\right), & l_i \le s(n) \le u_i, \\
0.03, & s(n) > u_i.
\end{cases}
$$

We then have

$$
r(n) = r_i(n) + r_a(n).
$$ 

Since the interest is charged monthly and is compound, we find that the interest
owed in month $n+1$ is given by

$$
i(n+1) = \frac{r(n)}{12} d(n).
$$

Furthermore, letting the lower repayment threshold be denoted by $l_r = £26,575$,
the automatic repayment contribution in month $n+1$ is given by

$$
p_a(n+1) =
\begin{cases}
0, & s(n) < l_r,\\
0.09(s(n) - l_r), & s(n) \ge l_r.
\end{cases}
$$

We're finally ready to give an expression for the debt at time $n+1$ in terms
of the quantities in month $n$. This quantity is the sum of the debt in month 
$n$ and the interest accrued in month $n$, minus the payment made at the start
of month $n+1$. Thus, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d(n+1) & = d(n) + i(n+1) - p(n+1) \\
    & = \left(1 + \frac{r(n)}{12}\right)d(n) - p(n+1).
\end{aligned}
$$

To the mathematically inclined, you will notice that the above represents
a difference equation, a discrete time version of an ordinary differential
equation (ODE). If the repayment term $p(n+1)$ vanished, the above
would simply represent the discrete-time equivalent of an exponential growth 
model. All of this is a fancy way of saying that if your monthly repayments
$p(n+1)$ are not sufficient to outpace the interest rate $r(n)$, then you will
find yourself on the wrong side of an exponential growth curve, and you will *very*
quickly find that your student debt blows so far out of proportion that early
repayment becomes practically impossible.

Finally, the total amount paid during the lifetime of the loan is given by

$$
P = \sum_{n=1}^N p(n),
$$

where $N$ is the minimum of 360 months (the 30 years before the loan is written
off) and the first $n$ such that $d(n)$ hits zero, i.e.

$$
N := \min\left(360, \min_n \{d(n) \le 0 \}\right).
$$

#### Comparing strategies
Now that we have the notation in place, it is easy to define a **repayment
strategy**. By repayment strategy, I refer to a sequence of additional
repayment contributions $p_a(1),\ldots,p_a(N)$, where clearly, each of 
the $p_a(n) \ge 0$. 

I think a good yard-stick for a strategy is the **effective rate of interest** 
one ends up paying throughout the lifetime of their loan. This value 
essentially represents a yearly **return** that the government makes off of you
during the lifetime of your loan, and hence can be viewed as an equal and 
opposite **negative return** to you, the holder of the loan. Starting with a
loan of $£D$, if one was to to pay off their loan in $N$ months and to pay a
total amount of $£P$ across the lifetime of the loan in doing do, then we could 
say that the debtor paid a nominal annual rate $r_m$ with monthly compounding, 
where $r_m$ satisfies

$$
\left(1 + \frac{r_m}{12}\right)^N \cdot D = P,
$$
or, upon rearranging,

$$
r_m = 12 \left[\left(\frac{P}{D}\right)^{1/N} - 1\right].
$$

To get the effective rate of interest $r$, we then find

$$
r = \left(1 + \frac{r_m}{12}\right)^{12} - 1.
$$
Upon using the above expression for $r_m$, this gives

$$
r = \left( \frac{P}{D}\right)^{12/N} - 1.
$$

Hopefully it is clear that this formula is consistent with reality. If one
decided to pay off their entire student loan in the first month of repayment
(perhaps they had the ability to take out another loan with better terms 
elsewhere), then they would accrue no interest, close out their loan, and pay
$P=D$, giving an effective rate of $r=0$, as you would expect.

#### Assumptions
While the framework we have built above is fairly general and allows for a lot
of flexibility in the various different parameters, in order to generate useful
results that we can compare easily, we need to add some assumptions and 
constraints. The aim in this analysis is to give a **ballpark figure** for the 
effective interest rates of different strategies, not an exact value. What is 
important is that the effectiveness of various strategies relative to one 
another is accurately modelled, not necessarily the final values themselves.

A few assumptions have already been *baked in*. One of these is that the maximum
additional interest rate one pays will always be 3% and that the upper and lower
thresholds will remain where they are. The government is capable of changing these
figures and has done so periodically. Nonetheless, building a model to predict
where these values are headed in the coming weeks and months is beyond the scope
of this post, and would only give marginally more accurate results.
