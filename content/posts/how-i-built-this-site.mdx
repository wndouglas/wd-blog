Building a website has been on my to-do list for a few years now. I've wanted a
platform to showcase my work and to expand on thoughts and ideas I have
during my downtime from work. With working from home being the new norm due
to the terrible COVID-19 pandemic I, like many, have found myself with
some extra time saved from my lack of commute. I decided it was finally time to
bite the bullet and build a site. In this post I will go through the
various different software tools I used to develop this site and give some
reasoning as to why I went the route that I did.

## Gatsby
Coming into this project I had very little web development experience. I did,
however, have significant software development experience. I figured it couldn't 
be that hard to pick up front-end web development, especially having come from
a C++ background, a language many regard as the toughest out there to master. I 
was wrong. Web development *is* hard, but maybe not for the same reason as a 
language like C++ is hard. When it comes to web development, the difficultly lies
in the sheer amount of *stuff* to learn. On top of this, there's about a million
different **frameworks**, **libraries**, **CMS** or **website builders** to 
choose from. Introductory courses point you to massive flow-charts of learning, 
roadmaps telling you just how many different technologies you need to learn 
before you can call yourself a web developer. I figured the best way to get 
started was to just to get stuck in. 

I wanted a solution that gave me exposure to the underlying code (and hence gave
me flexibility and control), without reaching for a cookie-cutter solution like 
*WordPress* or *Squarespace*. I ended up settling on 
**Gatsby**. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> is a **web 
framework** (a bundle of code and functionality that makes building a 
website or application much easier),  built on top of a **Javascript** library 
called **React**. React is a massively popular technology, originally developed 
by Facebook and since released to the public, that gives users a unique and 
flexible way to build web applications. The problem with React is that there is 
a *huge* amount of setup required before a single line of code can be written.
Gatsby solves this problem by taking care of all the complex setup for you, 
taking away some of your freedom while allowing you to focus on what matters 
(in this case my site). 

Gatsby falls under a category of frameworks known as **static site generators**. 
Static site generators take your content and generate a bundle of purely static 
HTML pages. This is great because all the **web server** hosting the site needs
to do is return a file - all of the work constructing the pages on the site has
been done a priori. There are many options available in this space. 
Two other popular choices are **Jekyll** and **Hugo**. 
The Gatsby homepage provides a 
comprehensive <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-jekyll-vs-hugo/">
comparison</a> between the three and hopefully sheds light on why I stuck with 
Gatsby. Essentially, I decided that I wanted a static site generator that 
allowed me to leverage the power of modern Javascript and React.

## Netlify
Once I had decided that Gatsby was my preferred choice of framework, I needed 
somewhere to **host** my site. A static site on its own is just a bundle of 
files. To actually make the site live and available to the public, the site 
needs a piece of technology called a **web server**. While it *is* theoretically 
possible to use your own machine as a web server, doing so is quite 
possibly in breach of you ISP's terms of service. I didn't fancy losing my 
internet, so along came 
**Netlify**. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> is a platform that 
automates every stage of the server deployment process of a static site. What 
sold me on Netlify (Netlify is actually free for individual use) was the ease 
with which a **GitHub** repository can be hooked up. In about 5 minutes of work,
I was able to connect Netlify to a repository containing my code, and have
it automatically trigger a rebuild every time I push new code to my repository.
In this way, I was able to completely automate the build process of my site. All
I have to focus on is the site itself, none of the fiddly **DevOps** work.

## WordPress on the Backend
While I specifically stated above that I didn't want to use WordPress to create
my site, I did *use* WordPress. WordPress is a big, bloated mess of plugins and
security issues. However, WordPress is *great* as a way of *managing content*.
I wanted a central place to store all of the posts, articles and tutorials I
write, but I didn't want to use WordPress as the user facing **front-end** of
my site. Welcome to **headless WordPress** and Gatsby **plugins**. WordPress
exposes what is known as a **REST API**, or **Application Programming
Interface**, essentially a specific set of endpoints that another user 
can use to retrieve data from a WordPress site. By using this API, a user is 
able to pull in posts and data from a WordPress site configured to allow it.
Using a plugin written specifically for this purpose, it was incredibly easy to
configure Gatsby to pull in the data from my WordPress account. Once I had settled
on this approach, I went ahead and setup 
a free-tier <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> account and 
configured Gatsby to pull in the data from my account. 

A final useful feature
I got up and running was a Netlify webhook that triggers a rebuild every time a
new piece of content is added to my WordPress page. Now, every time I write an 
article or post, Netlify is automatically informed and my site rebuilt. See
this <a href="https://adam-mould.co.uk/building-deploying-gatsby-wordpress-api-netlify/">site</a>
for a tutorial on how this can be done.

## Summary
While building a website from scratch is not as easy as using an out-of-the-box
tool like Wordpress, Squarespace or Wix, it *doesn't* have to be an overwhelming
task, even for a beginner like me. By using a combination of: Gatsby, GitHub,
Netlify and WordPress, I was able to streamline the whole process in such a way
that allows me to benefit from all of the strengths of WordPress, all of the
power of Gatsby, and all without the pain of DevOps.
